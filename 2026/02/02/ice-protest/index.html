      On Friday, over 1,000 demonstrators rallied in Providence as part of a
      nationwide day of protest against recent escalations in federal
      immigration enforcement in Minneapolis — including the deaths of two U.S.
      citizens at the hands of immigration officials earlier this month.<br /><br />
      At Brown, students and community members gathered on the steps of the John
      D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library at 1 p.m. as part of a student walkout. In
      sub-freezing temperatures, organizers led around 1,000 protesters in
      chants, yelling “All unite for immigrants’ rights” and “ICE is not welcome
      here.”<br /><br />
      In an attempt at “shutting down business as usual,” student leaders called
      on the College Hill community to join the walkout rather than attend class
      on Friday afternoon, said Brown Rise Up Co-President Simon Aron ’28. The
      walkout was organized by a coalition of activist groups, including BRU,
      Sunrise Brown, the Deportation Defense Network and the R.I. Student
      Climate Coalition.

      Friday’s rallies come in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti on
      Jan. 24. Pretti was the second person to be killed by immigration
      officials in Minneapolis this month, following the shooting of Renee Good
      on Jan. 7. <br /><br />
      Over the past several months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
      agents have been active in Providence. In November and September,
      individuals were detained on College Hill. Two weeks ago, several agents
      breached security at Garrahy Judicial Complex as they pursued two men
      through the building.

      Just before 2 p.m., protestors marched down College Hill and along Main
      Street to join a citywide protest at the Rhode Island State House,
      stopping traffic along the way. There, they met with around 1,000
      additional protestors.<br /><br />

      The rally at the State House was organized by local groups such as the
      Rhode Island chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, Alliance
      to Mobilize Our Resistance and the Providence Student Union.<br /><br />

      After several speeches, the crowd marched along Canal Street and through
      downtown Providence, chanting “ICE off our streets” and “shut it down.”

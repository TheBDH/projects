            over its claim to fame as the second-largest carpeted mall in the
            world, Providence Place has survived various economic threats,
            including the 2008 Great Recession and the sweeping technological
            advancements of the 2010s — but not without incident.<br /><br />
            The mall has faced its share of tribulations, including changing
            ownership, court receivership and the closure of almost all of its
            original anchor stores.<br /><br />
            Some of this can be attributed to an increase in Americans’ tendency
            to shop online, compounded by a decrease in the strength of anchor
            stores, with staple mall franchises like

            announcing sweeping closures across their brick-and-mortar
            locations. In fact, while the rise of online shopping and the drop
            in consumerism amid the COVID-19 pandemic have intensified concern
            for the future of malls in recent years, national trends have long
            predicted the death of the American mall.<br /><br />

            Still, it remains uncertain whether Providence Place, now facing
            court-ordered receivership, will adapt with the changing times or
            join the ranks of the many shuttered malls in the United States.<br /><br />

            <b class="subheading">1980s: The dawn of the mall</b><br /><br />
            In the 1980s, the area between downtown Providence and the Rhode
            Island State House — where the mall now stands — looked very
            different.<br /><br />
            Originally, railroad tracks stretched across this area, dubbed the
            Capital Center. In 1982, the state approved a $126 million project
            to move the tracks behind Union Station, the train station that used
            to serve downtown Providence. The city’s current Amtrak station
            would later be built in 1986.<br /><br />
            This relocation left the parking lots between Union Station and the
            State House open for development.<br /><br />
            The Capital Center Commission was tasked with overseeing development
            and economic growth around the State House, according to former CCC
            Chair Deming Sherman.<br /><br />
            The CCC’s job was to develop the newly open area into something “as
            attractive as possible,” without interfering with the view of the
            State House, Sherman said in a recent interview with The Herald.<br /><br />
            Around the time the tracks were relocated, Joseph Paolino Jr. P’06
            P’16 — former mayor of Providence and former director of the Rhode
            Island Department of Economic Development — heard a developer was
            interested in the lot on which the mall stands today.<br /><br />
            This developer initially hoped to build office space on the lot,
            Paolino said in a recent interview with The Herald. But Paolino
            recalled receiving pushback for that plan, noting that some
            individuals involved in deciding how to develop the area didn’t
            believe Providence had a “very good office market.”<br /><br />
            The developer later came back with a senior real estate developer
            for Macy’s and a new idea, Paolina said: The lot should become a
            mall.<br /><br />
            The proposed mall project was initially supposed to cost $300
            million and open by 1991. The project was backed by Melvin Simon and
            Associates, one of the largest shopping mall developers in the
            United States at the time and a precursor to Simon Property Group,
            currently the largest mall owner in the United States.<br /><br />
            But construction was delayed by factors such as developer shake-ups,
            issues with acquiring land from Amtrak and debates over the mall’s
            financial terms. The mall’s finalized financial agreement with the
            city, which promised 30 years of property tax stabilization
            beginning in 2000, wasn’t signed until 1996. By then, Paolino had
            been succeeded by Vincent “Buddy” Cianci Jr. as mayor and no longer
            directed the R.I. Department of Economic Development.<br /><br />

            <b class="subheading">1994: Discovering a criminal foundation</b
            ><br /><br />
            In 1994, in accordance with federal permitting requirements, a team
            of archaeologists from the Pawtucket-based Public Archaeology Lab
            investigated the open lot for historic and archaeological remains.
            What they discovered surprised them.<br /><br />
            “We found the entire (Rhode Island State) Prison with walls and the
            cells and bed frames,” said Deborah Cox MA’82, the firm’s longtime
            president, in a recent interview with The Herald.<br /><br />
            According to PAL archaeology laboratory manager and archivist
            Heather Olson, the prison was opened in 1838. Conditions were poor,
            Olson said, explaining that the prison was “an imposing stone
            structure” designed around a rehabilitative philosophy of solitary
            confinement and trade skills to prepare prisoners to reenter
            society. By the late 1860s, prisoners were transferred by foot to a
            new facility in Cranston. Eventually, the remaining structure was
            filled in to serve as the foundation for the Rhode Island Normal
            School, preceding what is now a parking lot for the University of
            Rhode Island.<br /><br />
            After this discovery, the archaeological site was open to the public
            for tours, according to Olson. There were even initial ideas of
            putting up an “artifact exhibit in the mall when it first opened,
            but it never ended up working out,” she said.<br /><br />

          <div class="step" data-step="3">
            <b class="subheading">1996 to 1999: Breaking ground</b><br /><br />
            The $360 million project was formally approved by the Providence
            City Council in 1996. Designed by Providence-based architect
            Friedrich St. Florian and Boston-based architecture and design firm
            Arrowstreet, the building was supposed to be “an elegant blend of
            older building forms — part 19th-century commercial block, part
            classic department store and part European galleria,” according to a
            Providence Journal
            <a

            at the time.<br /><br />
            The mall’s design included over 1.4 million square feet of retail
            space and over 4,000 parking spaces.<br /><br />
            After years of planning and construction, the Providence Place Mall
            opened on Aug. 20, 1999. The project came in $100 million over
            budget at $460 million, becoming one of the state’s most expensive
            development projects at the time.<br /><br />
            “I was excited,” Paolino told The Herald. “That was one of the
            greatest projects ever built in downtown Providence and the state of
            Rhode Island.”<br /><br />
            A gala was held inside the mall on the eve of its opening day to
            celebrate the occasion. “It was black tie … the place was crawling
            with people having hors d’oeuvres and drinks,” Sherman said. The
            event’s attendees included Robert Weygand, one of Rhode Island’s
            U.S. representatives at the time, and Lincoln Almond, then governor
            of Rhode Island.<br /><br />
            Fewer than half of the mall’s stores were open on the first day, yet
            crowds streamed through the doors, eager to be the first people to
            experience the new shopping center. At the time, the mall’s anchor
            stores — large stores commonly positioned at the end of the mall
            that often draw most of the center’s traffic — were Nordstrom and
            Filene’s, two department stores later joined by Lord and Taylor, a
            third.<br /><br />

            ><br /><br />
            The mall is not popular among all Providence residents, with some
            feeling that the city misallocated its resources.<br /><br />
            “It’s $250 million plus in tax breaks and incentives for there to be
            a Nordstrom,” said Adriana Valdez Young ’01, who was a student at
            Brown in the mall’s early years. “It’s just one of these very
            laughable moments of capitalism.”<br /><br />
            To Valdez Young, the mall, even in its current state, acts as a
            “boundary” that separates immigrant communities on the west side of
            Providence from the “very resourced neighborhoods” in the rest of
            the city.<br /><br />

            with the mall’s construction and led to the destruction of mill
            buildings in Eagle Square, which had operated as a hub for artists
            like Valdez Young.<br /><br />
            While working on an art installation with three other artists —
            Michael Townsend, Jay Zehngebot and James Mercer — Valdez Young
            heard a radio advertisement for the mall, she recalled.<br /><br />
            According to Valdez Young, the commercial was narrated by a mother
            saying that the Providence Place Mall made shopping so convenient
            for her family and ended with the tagline “if only I could live
            there.”<br /><br />
            “In that moment, I was like, ‘Yes, we should live there. That’s what
            they want, that’s the future of the city and the Providence they’re
            building, so let’s just go now,’” Valdez Young said.<br /><br />
            After coming up with the idea, the four artists originally planned
            on spending four days in the mall as a competition until they got
            caught, Valdez Young said. But after staying for four days and
            discovering a 750-square-foot empty space, she explained, the group
            decided to build a secret apartment in the mall.<br /><br />
            “We thought we were so funny,” Valdez Young said. “This is
            underutilized space — the same argument that real estate developers
            (were) using when they (were) justifying knocking down all those
            mill buildings.”<br /><br />
            The artists slowly constructed the apartment inside the mall,
            eventually building a wall with a locked door and outfitting the
            space with a couch, waffle maker and PlayStation. The artists
            periodically lived in the apartment undiscovered over four years —
            though Valdez Young moved to New York after two.<br /><br />

            Just six years after the mall opened, its flagship stores were

            their doors, although 15 new stores had opened or were planned to
            open in their place.<br /><br />
            Soon after Filene’s came under the ownership of Federated Department
            Stores — now Macy’s, Inc — in 2005, its Providence Place location
            was converted to a Macy’s. Lord & Taylor closed in 2005 as well,
            later replaced by JCPenney.<br /><br />
            “Penney’s was the number one requested store in our research,”

            Monique Murphy, a store manager for JCPenney at the Providence Place
            Mall when the flagship first opened, described opening day as
            “really exciting” in a recent interview with The Herald. She
            recalled many members of JCPenney’s corporate branch coming to the
            store to prepare for its grand opening.<br /><br />
            One of these corporate visitors was the granddaughter of
            entrepreneur James Cash Penney, the company’s founder, who “came and
            talked to all of the employees, all the associates before opening
            and thanked everybody for coming to work at JCPenney,” Murphy
            recalled.<br /><br />
            Before opening day, the store’s staff had “a lot of help” from the
            company’s district teams, who spent “days at a time making sure the
            store looks great,” Murphy said. There was “great teamwork to make
            it all happen.”<br /><br />
            In the wake of the 2008 economic downturn, General Growth Properties
            — the owner of the mall between 2004 and 2018 — faced $27 billion in
            debt. Though the Providence Place Mall had generated just shy of $14
            million in sales taxes for Rhode Island in 2007, the GGP listed the
            mall for sale in early 2009 to help pay off its debt,

            over the bottom two floors of the former department store for 150
            new parking spaces. The project, which cost over $20 million, also
            installed a new digital parking system, alongside other
            improvements.<br /><br />
            In 2018, Nordstrom announced it would be leaving Providence Place
            the following January. “When we look at our business in the
            Providence market, we determined it made most sense to end our
            Providence Place lease,” said Jamie Nordstrom, then-president of the
            company’s stores, in a press release at the time.<br /><br />
            The department store had opened as the mall’s first tenant. Before
            construction of the mall had even completed, Paolino had traveled to
            Seattle with then-mayor Cianci and then-governor Bruce Sundlun to
            persuade the Nordstrom family to open a location at Providence
            Place, according to
            <a

              class="hyperlinked"
              >previous Herald reporting.</a
            ><br /><br />
            “To have Nordstrom there, that was an anchor that would bring
            shoppers to visit Rhode Island,” Paolino said in a recent interview
            with The Herald.<br /><br />
            The Herald spoke to many current mall shoppers who shared that they
            mourn the loss of the flagship store, citing its departure as a
            reason they no longer visit the mall as frequently. “I stopped going
            after Nordstrom moved out,” Cox affirmed.<br /><br />
            Paolino said that the city government at the time should have taken
            more steps to prevent the closure. “They should have done everything
            they could to have kept them,” he said.<br /><br />
            Boscov’s succeeded Nordstrom in the fall of 2019. Based in
            Pennsylvania, the family-owned department store was the first of its
            chain to arrive in Rhode Island and is

            for partnering with local nonprofits.<br /><br />
            In one program, the store gives nonprofits multiple one-day-only 25%
            off coupons, which they can sell for five dollars, Store Manager
            Victoria Belair said. The nonprofits keep 100% of the proceeds from
            the voucher sales.<br /><br />
            In previous Herald reporting, Chairman and CEO Jim Boscov emphasized
            the store’s mission to be a “member of the community.” The store is
            distinguished by its low prices, which are “sharper than anything
            people have seen in the past,” Boscov added.<br /><br />
            Lucy de Jesus is a floor manager who has worked at the store since
            its opening.<br /><br />
            “It’s like my second house,” de Jesus said. Every day, she looks
            forward to her morning meetings with her coworkers, who “feel like
            family here.”<br /><br />
            While customers dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, foot traffic
            seems to have returned to pre-pandemic levels, de Jesus said.<br /><br />
            The store held its big 20% off sale on Nov. 15. It was quiet, with
            only a couple of customers shopping for items as many customer
            service kiosks sat empty.<br /><br />
            Cheryl White was searching for a pair of socks. She has been a
            regular customer since the store opened in 2019, she told The
            Herald, often coming twice or three times a month. But “I’m not a
            mall girl,” she admitted. “They’re overpriced.”<br /><br />
            But Boscov’s pricing brings her to Providence Place, even though
            there’s another mall closer to where she lives in Warwick.<br /><br />
            “I look for the deals,” she explained.<br /><br />
            Donna Vento and Donna Folcarelli, both shoppers at the mall on Nov.
            15, told The Herald that the store’s affordability is a draw. The
            two had never shopped at Nordstrom, and only came after Boscov’s
            opened.<br /><br />
            “The prices in here are a lot better,” said Vento, a retired nurse
            from Johnston. “You have the same items that you would buy at Kohl’s
            or Macy’s or Penney’s.”<br /><br />

            to bounce back in 2022.<br /><br />
            In October 2024, the Providence Place Mall was placed into
            court-ordered receivership after private lenders alleged that
            Brookfield owed $259 million after taking out $305 million in loans
            in 2011.<br /><br />
            In an email to The Herald, Mark Russo, a West Warwick-based attorney
            and temporary receiver of the mall, wrote that “it has taken us about
            a year to stabilize the property” since the beginning of the
            receivership. Under receivership, the mall has undergone renovations
            to the parking garage and updated its code of conduct, which
            <a

            groups of four or more people and outlines other policies banning
            unaccompanied minors in the mall during certain hours.<br /><br />
            “The former operator had allowed security and housekeeping hours to
            dip to unacceptable levels,” Russo wrote. “The Providence Place Mall
            had somewhat of an earned perception as no longer being attractive
            to patrons because it had become a hangout.”<br /><br />
            According to Russo, the receivership has also addressed renovation
            issues that were deferred by past management. Russo said that mall
            operators discovered outdated facilities while receivers were in the
            process of finding a new theater operator after National Amusements,
            the parent company of Showcase Cinemas, ended its lease at
            Providence Place.<br /><br />
            “We came to discover that the HVAC system for the theater was the
            original from when the mall was first built some 25 years ago,”
            Russo wrote. “Accordingly, we will be replacing those rooftop units
            in April of 2026.”<br /><br />
            As part of the mall’s receivership process, Centennial Real Estate
            Management took over management of Providence Place from Brookfield
            Properties. While Centennial’s role in the mall after the
            receivership remains uncertain, Russo says he is “hopeful that
            Centennial will consider remaining involved with a buyer, but that
            is to be a decision to be made by the buyer and Centennial.”<br /><br />
            Russo expects the mall to go to market “sometime this month” and
            “would imagine that a sale process will take at least three to four
            months to complete.” He estimated that the receivership will
            conclude by mid-2026.<br /><br />
            Brookfield did not respond to multiple requests for comment.<br /><br />
            According to Spencer Reith, a co-owner of Courtside Kicks in the
            mall, the management under the receivership has been “great.”<br /><br />
            “I think the new ownership has been doing a better job at promoting
            the mall and advertising it,” Reith told The Herald in April. “If
            anything, we’ve seen an uptick in the last few months for foot
            traffic.”<br /><br />

              In January 2024, Level99 — part arcade, part bar and restaurant —
              moved into the third floor lot, formerly the site of JCPenney.
              According to Matthew DuPlessie, founder and CEO of Level99, the
              demographics of nearby residents make Providence Place a good fit
              for the concept.<br /><br />
              “The peak of our demographic curve is young adults who are
              mentally, socially and physically active people who want to get
              out and do things,” DuPlessie said. “There’s a lot of that in
              Providence.”<br /><br />
              According to DuPlessie, the mall’s receivership has not hindered
              operations.<br /><br />
              “The average person going to Providence Place isn’t aware or
              doesn’t care who the owner is,” DuPlessie said. “They care how the
              facility is kept, they care about what the tenant mix is.”<br /><br />
              He added that the business has seen a “positive” change since the
              receivership went into effect.<br /><br />
              “The new ownership is actually spending money again,” DuPlessie
              said. He explained that new managers have fixed elevators,
              installed new equipment for gates and introduced access control
              for parking.<br /><br />
              Providence Place has housed an IMAX-capable movie theater above
              its food court since its first year of operations. So when

              trampoline park and a bar in the space.<br /><br />
              For current employee Amanda Graves, who worked at Showcase for
              “probably almost a year” before Apple Cinemas began running the
              space, the transition has been somewhat “stressful” because
              “everything’s changing.”<br /><br />
              Apple Cinemas did not respond to multiple requests for comment.<br /><br />
              Two weeks after Apple Cinemas began business at the mall, Graves
              told The Herald that the theater has been “pretty dead,” except
              for when new movies come out.<br /><br />
              “We get a good amount of people, but not as much as we did for
              Showcase,” Graves said. She added that this decrease in customers
              might be because “people don’t believe yet that Apple Cinemas is
              open.”<br /><br />
              When Showcase announced its departure from Providence Place in
              October, Carter Via ’28 told The Herald that he was “heartbroken”
              and that going to see movies with his friends during his first
              year at Brown was “formative” and “a lot of fun.”<br /><br />
              After hearing that Apple Cinemas would continue to operate the
              theater, some students expressed cautious optimism and relief in
              interviews with The Herald.<br /><br />
              “I actually have a lot of really good memories going with friends
              to watch a movie, pretty spontaneously, (on) random Friday,
              Saturday nights,” Finnur Christianson ’27 said in November.<br /><br />

              ><br /><br />
              Weathering the decades of storms plaguing the Providence Place
              Mall, one anchor business has managed to stay steady. Dave and
              Buster’s has remained in its location across from the movie
              theater, hosting children’s birthdays and welcoming guests for
              arcade games since 2000. On the morning of Nov. 15, many of the
              chain’s guests were grandparents spending some time with their
              grandchildren.<br /><br />
              “He loves coming here,” said Dave and Buster’s visitor Mary
              Millard, gesturing to her grandson, who was immersed in an arcade
              game. “This is really the only thing, other than Level99, for kids
              their age.”<br /><br />
              Millard said she had been coming to Providence Place since the
              mall first opened.<br /><br />
              “We’ve lived here for a long time,” Millard said. “We were coming
              here with our sons when they were like 18, 22.”<br /><br />
              Nurisbel Santana, who has worked at Dave and Buster’s for close to
              half a year, enjoys the “hands-on experience” of her job.<br /><br />
              Working the front desk, Santana sees customers come in for parties
              at many milestones in life, from kids’ birthdays, to graduation
              celebrations, to bachelorette parties.<br /><br />
              “I love seeing little kids coming in for the first time and walk
              out like, ‘That was awesome!’” Santana said.<br /><br />
              Jaime Pereira, the manager at the Providence Place Dave & Buster’s
              since August 2024, said that the business has prioritized “adding
              value” for guests to try and increase foot traffic amid recent
              mall shakeups.<br /><br />
              Some examples include the “Eat and Play” combo, which allows
              guests to pair an entree with a $10 game play card, and seasonal
              game play passes, which Dave and Buster's staff can offer to
              guests at parties to entice them to return.<br /><br />
              “Obviously, the games are a big draw,” Pereira said. “That’s,
              like, 70% of our income.” According to Pereira, the Providence
              Place Dave and Buster’s has benefitted from a “lack of competition
              in the area” — a sentiment that multiple visitors shared.<br /><br />
              “Dave and Busters offers something that’s not duplicated anywhere
              nearby,” Pereira added.<br /><br />
              For Santana, the business’s success over so many years is
              attributed to a simple principle: “If it’s not broken, don’t fix
              it.”<br /><br />

            To some, the Providence Place Mall has lost its allure.<br /><br />
            In conversations with The Herald, some Rhode Island shoppers said
            they have turned to other shopping centers, like Garden City Center
            in Cranston or The Crossing at Smithfield. Others said they rarely
            come to the mall, preferring to do their shopping online.<br /><br />

            Sherman said. “Twenty years ago, there would be a new mall every
            week.”<br /><br />
            But some malls are finding ways to keep people coming back. Stores
            like Dave and Buster’s and Level99 are examples of

            Although the Providence Place Mall has faced its fair share of
            challenges, the carpeted walkways still bustled with energy when The
            Herald visited the mall in November. Couples sat in the food court
            and families toted armfuls of shopping bags.<br /><br />
            “As somebody who is here literally every single day, I’m very
            honestly confused about the mass misconception about the fact that
            the mall is doing bad,” said TraciMarie Chandler, a manager at the
            Coffee Cup, a coffee shop in the mall.<br /><br />
            For Chandler, the mall is the “most community-based job (she’s)
            worked at.”<br /><br />
            “I personally love working here,” she said. “I don’t really see the
            mall closing any time soon.”<br /><br />
            For now, it looks like the Providence Place Mall — despite its
            troubles — is here to stay.<br /><br />

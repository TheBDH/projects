          <p>In fall 2024, 16,916 people made up the Brown community. From
            graduate students to professors to maintenance staff, every one of
            those people is part of Brown’s identity. The Herald’s data desk
            investigated demographic trends over the span of 20 years from 2004
            to 2024. This article explores who Brown is and was, starting from
            the biggest picture and steadily zooming in.

          <p>Brown has long stood out among Ivy League universities for its
            focus on undergraduate education. Brown considers itself a
            “university-college,” a term that former President Henry Wriston
            used to describe a liberal arts perspective towards education and
            research. That focus has shifted in recent decades as Brown has

            enrollment has also increased, but by a more modest 25%.</p>

          <p>The faculty category includes all employees in instructional or
            research positions. Faculty who both teach and research are
            categorized as instructional. Matching the growth in the student
            body, the total faculty count has grown by 58% since 2004. That
            increase was especially concentrated in research-only faculty, which
            has nearly doubled since 2004. This growth is likely to slow

            In 2024, Brown had 880 “regular faculty,” which includes professors
            and distinguished senior lecturers. In 2015, 66% of “regular
            faculty”
            were men and 34% were women, a gap that has somewhat narrowed in
            recent years to 60% men, 40% women in 2024.

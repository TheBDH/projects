    <h1>About this poll</h1>
<p>Welcome to The Herald’s fall 2023 poll. Between Oct. 10 and 12, Herald staffers surveyed over 1,100 undergraduate students on topics ranging from demographics and lifestyle to support for campus and national leaders. You can explore the data using our interactive site.</p>
<br>
<p>The Herald conducts a campus-wide poll each semester to identify trends in student opinions and experiences. The results of our spring 2023 poll are available <a href="https://projects.browndailyherald.com/2023/03/06/poll/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The Herald’s fall 2023 poll was conducted from Oct. 10 to 12 at three locations on campus: the Main Green, outside the Engineering Research Center and outside the Sharpe Refectory. It collected 1,111 responses over the three-day period. The poll only includes responses from undergraduate students, and responses to all questions were required to submit the poll. Responses were collected using Google Forms.</p>
<br>
<p>The Herald collected poll responses anonymously to protect the privacy of all students who participated. Only select senior members of The Herald’s staff had access to raw data for analysis. Response distributions for non-demographic questions are weighted by class year — using official University enrollment figures — to more accurately reflect the undergraduate student body.</p>
<br>
<p>Students reporting a winter graduation date were subsumed into summer graduation classes as follows: Students with a 2023.5 graduation year were counted alongside the class of 2024, and all other 0.5ers were grouped with the classes that will graduate one semester prior to them. For example, students with a 2025.5 graduation year were grouped with the class of 2025.</p>
<br>
<p>The Herald did not report cross tabulations for demographic groups with small response numbers to prevent misrepresenting their views.</p>

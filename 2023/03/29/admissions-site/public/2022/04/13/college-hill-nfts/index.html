          Imagine coming across a piece of art online as one-of-a-kind as the
          Mona Lisa. You decide to buy an NFT for that artwork — a kind of
          digital certificate of authenticity. Once the certificate is made, it
          is impossible to change. Anyone can see the full ownership history of
          the certificate, so you only have to verify that the original creator
          of the NFT is the artist to know that you own a legitimate
          certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simplified, this system of certificates is the technological value
          that NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, aim to bring to art: a trusted
          transaction between buyer and artist that removes anyone else from the
          equation.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Brown and Rhode Island School of Design, NFTs have become part of
          the curriculum for a student-run course and the marketplace of choice
          for a new art collective, sparking polarized discourse on their
          implications.

          Non-fungible, meaning non-replaceable, tokens are
          <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/what-is-an-nft.html"
            >created</a
          >
          and stored using blockchain technology. A
          <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp"
            >blockchain</a
          >
          is an unchangeable, universally-accessible digital list that securely
          records transaction history. This technology opens up new
          opportunities for how artists can make money from their art that are
          not possible with the sale of traditional paper art, according to
          Professor of Computer Science Maurice Herlihy, who serves as an
          advisor for blockchain developers and teaches the course CSCI 1951L:
          “Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies.”
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, the blockchain can be programmed to give the original
          artist of the NFT a percentage of the resale value every time it is
          sold, Herlihy said.
        </p>

        <p>
          This technology could prevent the fate of famous artists like Vincent
          Van Gogh, whose paintings skyrocketed in
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vincent-van-Gogh"
            >value long after his death while his</a
          >
          estate was left without a means of compensation from resales, he
          added.
        </p>

        <p>
          NFT ownership is
          <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/what-is-an-nft.html"
            >different</a
          >
          from traditional ownership because while owning a physical piece of
          artwork lets you control other people&#39;s access to that work,
          owning an NFT instead gives you an indisputable claim over that unique
          digital object, which is independent of the artwork itself and other
          people&#39;s ability to view it. Just like any other collectible, an
          NFT only holds as much monetary
          <a
            href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22313936/non-fungible-tokens-crypto-explained"
            >value</a
          >
          as others are willing to pay.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beginning with Bitcoin, early blockchains used a mechanism known as
          <a
            href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stake"
            >proof of work</a
          >, which essentially relies on using a computer to solve computational
          problems in order to “mint” an NFT. The first person to solve such an
          equation “mines” that spot.
          <a
            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/07/06/blockchain-mining-the-key-to-powering-a-decentralized-world/?sh=1bab73f25a11"
            >Mining</a
          >
          is essential to having a decentralized trust system, where no one
          individual or company has the power to verify the authenticity of the
          art and oversee transactions. These features of authenticity and
          transparency are the basis of blockchain technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          But proof of work is “hugely inefficient” in the amount of energy
          consumption required per transaction, Herlihy emphasized. The
          <a
            href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1263975/ethereum-binance-share-in-defi-tvl/"
            >most popular</a
          >
          blockchain for NFTs, Ethereum, has considered
          <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/#the-merge"
            >transitioning</a
          >
          from proof of work to a less energy-intensive mechanism called proof
          of stake.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than putting computers to work and using energy to create the
          decentralized trust mechanism, proof of stake utilizes a system where
          people stake their own crypto for the chance to validate a transaction
          and receive a reward in crypto for participating in the validation
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          While forms of cryptocurrencies have existed before, Bitcoin, and the
          popular blockchains that came after it, became the first decentralized
          transaction services to remove a middle man or operator, Herlihy said.
          Owned by no one, and open to anyone to use, this decentralization is
          fundamentally different from how digital transactions have operated.
        </p>

        <p>
          “People are realizing that blockchains are good for things more than
          simple payments,” Herlihy said — and NFTs have become a prime example.

          M3DIUM Studio, an NFT artist collective co-founded by RISD seniors
          Arlo Walker and Quinn Lockwood along with Lars Delin, a senior at
          Wesleyan University, launched March 14 on
          <a
            href="https://opensea.io/collection/m3dium-risd?search%5BsortBy%5D=PRICE&amp;search%5BsortAscending%5D=false"
            >OpenSea</a
          >, the world’s first and largest NFT marketplace, according to its
          website. The collective aims to be “the first ever NFT collection
          dedicated to the works of practicing student artists,” according to
          M3DIUM’s press release.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Our collective is “not like a bunch of monkey faces” created
          anonymously, Walker said, referring to the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs
          that have
          <a
            href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/18/what-is-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-apecoin-explained/"
            >sold for millions</a
          >. M3DIUM is “a community of people that decided to try something, and
          it&#39;s an … ongoing experiment.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The student-run collective was created with the goal of breaking down
          barriers and allowing student artists to monetize their work outside
          the traditional art market, where agents and galleries can be complex
          and
          <a
            href="https://www.format.com/magazine/resources/art/art-agent-artist-agency"
            >costly</a
          >
          to navigate, with commercial gallery representation estimated to cost
          the artist around a 50% commission. M3DIUM harnesses the collective
          fanbases and social media followings of its artists, Walker
          said.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The group also wants to influence where the NFT market is headed,
          Walker and Lockwood said. The co-founders hope to make the NFT market
          a place where artists can legitimize their work in a respected
          manner.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The name M3DIUM reflects the group’s aim to bring together art from
          different mediums, with the number three representing how the
          collective fits into
          <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/"
            >Web3</a
          >, a purported next generation of the internet that claims to be
          decentralized, Walker said. M3DIUM’s first collection features 82
          works from 35 artists including animated GIFs, scans of oil paintings,
          animated short films, photo prints and computer-generated
          images.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The co-founders said that curating artists for the collective meant
          finding a variety of art forms that would translate well to the NFT
          format. For instance, both digital art and physical art scanned into a
          digital format can be minted as NFTs into the collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each time a piece of art is sold, the artist and M3DIUM co-founders
          divide the profit 60% to 40% respectively, according to the artist
          contract. Prices are set between 0.1ETH and 0.3ETH, which is
          <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/converter/eth/usd">equivalent to</a>
          a range of around $300 to $900, though prices fluctuate, Delin wrote
          in an email to The Herald.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally, the collective planned to mint NFTs using Ethereum, which
          cost at least $100 to mint one NFT. The founders’ cut of the sale
          would have been used to cover some of the minting cost, Walker said,
          along with the fees to sell on OpenSea which the founders still cover.
          In response to backlash from other students over environmental
          concerns, M3DIUM switched from minting on the Ethereum blockchain to
          minting on Polygon, which uses proof of stake and has no
          <a
            href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-much-does-it-cost-to-create-an-nft/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20upfront%20costs,price%2C%20after%20it&#39;s%20first%20sold."
            >upfront</a
          >
          mining costs.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The terms of the contract have not changed since the collective’s move
          to Polygon, Delin wrote. The 40% cut is a lower charge to artists than
          the average traditional gallery, according to the founders. “And we do
          not have any exclusive rights to any of their work,” he added.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          If a piece of art is not sold, no transfer of money takes place,
          leading to a “zero risk” situation, he said. As of April 13, the
          collective had 3.6ETH traded in total sales for 21 items on its
          OpenSea page, equivalent to around $12,444. Since its launch, M3DIUM
          has been featured on Opensea’s list of “Notable Drops” on its homepage
          as well as its social media, which has helped the collective grow its
          following, the founders wrote.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The co-founders noted that M3DIUM’s goal is not to replace physical
          art. “We&#39;re attempting to use the NFT as basically a way for
          people to be patrons of (the artists’) physical art practice, as well
          as make digital art something that (the artists) could do on the
          side,” Walker said. They hope that buyers interested in an NFT can
          become exposed to the artist’s larger portfolio and learn more about
          their work.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The co-founders have ambitions to expand their NFT collections to
          include drops with artists from other top design schools and
          collaborate with nonprofits and Web2 companies looking to enter the
          NFT space.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          “We see Web3 and digital art like this being a core part of the
          curriculum at any design school within the next five to 10 years,”
          Walker said.

        <p>
          Instead of forming an art collective, some Brown students have
          approached NFTs in a classroom setting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ally Zhu ’22 and Nikolas Lazar ’22 were first formally introduced to
          NFTs while working together at management consulting company Arthur D.
          Little over the summer. After working on a project that involved NFTs,
          they became interested in the field and decided to form an independent
          study to get course credit and “dig more into the space,” Zhu said.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the fall, the two designed a syllabus to plan the logistics of the
          class and were surprised by how many students were interested in the
          course. Despite the high demand, they had to cap the class at 20 due

          According to the syllabus, the goals of the independent study include
          understanding the socio-economic, political and technological rise of
          blockchain technology in NFTs and creating informed predictions about
          the future of NFTs. The course looks at blockchains and NFTs from
          three perspectives: the arts, computer science and economics. The
          creators added that they consider the class’s slate of guest speakers
          from different backgrounds one of its highlights.

          The course concludes with a final NFT project, Zhu said. Students can
          choose to make this anything from an argumentative paper about the
          positive or negative role NFTs play in the art world to a computer
          science project on minting, launching and marketing a set of NFTs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Zhu has made her own NFT known as Paradise Lost. The art is one of her
          “favorite digital art pieces” that she has made, and she wanted to
          test out the blockchain technology for herself.
        </p>

          Although he’s one of the leaders of the class, Lazar is still pretty
          skeptical about NFTs and cryptocurrency as a whole, he said. But he
          believes this technology is here to stay, and he wants to learn more
          about the impact NFTs will have in areas such as politics or the
          environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I’m much more skeptical of crypto than I am of NFTs,” he said. “I
          think at least with NFTs there’s somewhat of a use. You can’t do
          anything with Bitcoin.”

          After announcing the creation of the M3DIUM Collective, the
          co-founders and artists in the group received criticism online from
          other RISD students as student artists split over whether they thought
          NFTs do more harm than good.
        </p>

        <p>
          Asher White, a RISD senior studying sculpture, was caught in the
          backlash after she expressed on social media that it was pointless and
          hypocritical to criticize people who sell NFTs.
        </p>

        <p>
          “In our fury at NFTs, we’re forgetting to look inwards toward the ways
          in which we’re all participating in a system of exploitation, which is
          the art institution and the gallery scene,” she said to The Herald.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the time of posting, she was unaware of M3DIUM and said anger was
          directed towards her for appearing to defend the group.
        </p>

        <p>
          “NFTs very quickly became the new thing to hate, but the thing we
          should hate is the ‘mechanisms’” that NFTs, RISD and elite galleries
          take part in, White said, explaining that these spaces ultimately
          tokenize, exploit and extract artists’ art “to be traded by
          millionaires and clout-chasers, reducing art to a site of
          commercialization.”
        </p>

        <p>
          While she said that she believes NFTs are “hollow certificates of
          value,” one benefit is the promise that the value of artists’ work
          will not be mediated by anything other than the market. She argued
          that the formation of a collective like M3DIUM “nullifies the appeal
          of the NFT” by having a third-party — the co-founders — involved in
          the art transactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          For some, such as Lindsay Caplan, assistant professor of history of
          art and architecture, NFTs cannot be viewed separately from
          cryptocurrency. From her background as a professor, she primarily
          views the NFT movement as “financial speculation,” or a risky
          financial endeavor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Caplan views NFTs as a natural continuation of the “long and exciting
          history of artists who are really thinking of new modes of creation
          and engagement.” But, she still is “deeply disturbed” by&nbsp; how the
          ease of access into the NFT market “cannot be uncoupled with right
          wing populism.” The
          <a
            href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/01/crypto-bitcoin-republicans-josh-mandel.html"
            >right wing leanings</a
          >
          of cryptocurrency advocates has been a documented trend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lately, established galleries such as Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Pace
          have even taken part in the metaverse and the presentation of NFTs.
          Caplan said that since these large galleries are participating in this
          space, it “may have staying power,” but she is unsure about the extent
          to which it will have a role in society.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I think NFTs will be there as a format. What kind of effects it will
          have remains to be seen,” she said. “Will more interesting artists
          pick up on it? Will we see more unexpected things? I hope so.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Professor Alex Poterack, lecturer in economics, described NFTs and
          their purpose as “very silly” in an email to The Herald. Poterack
          pointed out that someone could spend tens of millions of dollars on an
          original Rembrandt painting, but anyone could get a high resolution
          photo of the same painting for free. From an economic standpoint, he
          believes the value of the product is that it was painted by an artist
          “who&#39;s been dead for over 350 years.” He wrote that if someone
          painted an exact copy, it would be worth a fraction of the price.
        </p>

        <p>
          Poterack views cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, as a way to make
          it easier to “buy drugs” and “break the law.”
        </p>

        <p>
          “As near as I can tell the only financial pro is that NFTs make money
          laundering easier, … but even then, I&#39;m not sure,” he wrote. “Is
          it easier to launder money by selling a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT than
          by slapping some paint on a canvas and calling it contemporary art?”
        </p>

        <p>
          Herlihy expressed concerns over the lack of security around the
          ac​​tual artwork represented by the NFT, which is linked to the
          blockchain as a URL. For many existing NFTs, there aren’t technical
          measures to prevent the owner of the URL from vandalizing the file
          linked to the NFT, he said.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The part that&#39;s on the blockchain is tamper proof and secure, but
          the part you care about” –– the file linked to the NFT –– “is
          insecure,” he added.

          on the environment.

        <p>
          A problem with proof of work, the mechanism Etherum uses, is that as
          Bitcoin becomes more valuable, there will be “a lot more people
          effectively running their computers all the time to try and mine the
          Bitcoin,” said Ricardo Bayon, founder and partner of Encourage Capital
          and part of the advisory council for the Institute at Brown for
          Environment and Society. Encourage Capital is a “a new breed of asset
          management firm focused on profitable and strategic investments to
          solve critical social and environmental problems,”
          <a href="https://ibes.brown.edu/people/ricardo-bayon"
            >according to Bayon’s website.</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to running on proof of work, Ethereum’s latest annualized
          electricity consumption is estimated to be
          <a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption"
            >similar to the total electricity consumption of the Netherlands</a

          While types of blockchains and cryptocurrency may come and go, Herlihy
          believes some form of this technology is “inevitable.”
        </p>

        <p>
          “We need the ability to do global commerce (that) existing mechanisms
          aren&#39;t really set up to do,” he said. Centralized organizations
          like large credit card companies have established systems for risks
          like fraud, but they take time to process and charge fees on every
          transaction for managing all of these payments.
        </p>

        <p>
          “If you can replace them with something that works just as well but is
          more decentralized, then the world would be in a better place,” he
          said. But current blockchain replacements are not yet better than
          standard means of payment, he added.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to a
          <a
            href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1265891/ethereum-energy-consumption-transaction-comparison-visa/"
            >January estimate</a
          >, one Ethereum transaction consumed as much energy as several hundred
          thousand VISA transactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bayon is skeptical about whether renewable energy efforts are in the
          near future for cryptocurrency transactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Some of the advocates of Bitcoin and the proof of work mechanism say
          the future is going to be renewable energy powering the mine,” Bayon
          said. “I don’t think we’re there yet and we’ll see if that’s the way
          it comes.”

    <p>The class of 2025 was most represented in this semester’s poll, making up 29% of respondents, followed closely by the
      class of 2026 at 28% and the class of 2024 at 24%. Only 14% of respondents were members of the class of 2023. Close to
      5% of respondents were mid-year graduates, or members of the classes of 2022.5, 2023.5, 2024.5 and 2025.5. This poll has
      been weighted by graduation year.
    </p>
    <br>
      <p>
        In previous years, The Herald did not collect specific data on mid-year graduates. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
        different graduating classes have had vastly different Brown experiences, complicating the process of

      <p>Physical science including math and computer science was the most popular intended concentration area among
        respondents, accounting for roughly 42% of respondents. Social sciences followed at 30%, then humanities and arts at
        roughly 27% and life sciences at nearly 24%. Just over 5% of respondents reported being unsure of their intended
        concentration.

          Pre-professionalism is on the rise at Brown. Courses offered by departments such as computer science, economics and
          engineering have
          <a href="https://oir.brown.edu/institutional-data/factbooks/courses">increased</a>
          over the past decade — computer science courses have almost doubled since the 2012-13 academic year — while humanities
          departments such as history, English and anthropology have dropped in the number of courses offered, according to
          Brown’s Office of Institutional Research. Computer science, economics, biology and history were the
          <a href="https://oir.brown.edu/institutional-data">top baccalaureate completions</a>
          in 2021.
        </p>
        <br>
          <p>
            Respondents were permitted to select more than one concentration field, which is why total percentages exceed 100. In
            recent semesters, University departments have added new

            A majority of poll respondents — 52% — identified as female, while 44% identified as male. Female respondents similarly
            represented a plurality in the spring 2022 poll, but not a majority as they did in this semester’s poll.
          </p>
          <br>
            <p>According to
              <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/10/12/boys-left-behind-education-gender-gaps-across-the-us/">The
                Brookings Institute</a>
              , young women are more likely than men to have graduated college in every U.S. state. In Rhode Island, women aged 25 to
              34 are 25% more likely than men to have a bachelor’s degree. Increased female enrollment in higher education has
              occurred alongside the “growing labor force participation as well as structural changes in the economy,” according to
              <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/#:~:text=Young%20women%20are%20more%20likely,adults%20ages%2025%20to%2034">
                the Pew Research Center</a>, and financial considerations were a major reason why many don’t complete their degree.
            </p>
            <br>
              <p>Results were otherwise similar to our previous poll. About 5% of respondents identified as nonbinary. In the 2020-21
                academic year, the University
                <a href="https://diap.brown.edu/data/diversity-dashboards/student-data/students-gender">reported</a>
                that 52.73% of its undergraduates were women, while 47.27% were men. The University reports this information according
                to a gender binary per federal requirements, meaning we cannot precisely compare the demographics of survey respondents
                to University data.</p>

              <p>A slight majority — 53% — of respondents identified as white, similar to the 55% of white respondents in the spring
                2022 poll. About one third of respondents identified as Asian, which similarly mirrored last semester’s poll. Close to
                13% of respondents identified as Black, almost 12% identified as Hispanic and roughly 3% identified as Middle Eastern or
                North African. Fewer than 1% of respondents identified as Native American/Alaska Native and fewer than 1% identified as
                Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. The Middle Eastern or North African option was a new addition to this semester’s poll.

                For comparison, according to the University’s 2021-22 ,<a href="https://oir.brown.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/CDS_2021_2022.pdf">Common Data Set</a>
                — which does not track the racial or ethnic identities of international students — just over 41% of degree-seeking
                undergraduates were white, 18.2% were Asian, 11.3% were Hispanic or Latino and 7.6% were Black or African American. The
                CDS counts those who identify as two or more races in a separate category.

                Racial diversity at Brown has increased only slightly in recent years. According to the University’s

                  Action Plan</a>
                , the percentage of undergraduates from historically underrepresented groups — defined as African American/Black,
                Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander — has increased from 20.8% in
                the 2014-15 academic year to 22% in the 2020-21 academic year.

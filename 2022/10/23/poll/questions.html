      <p>Rhode Island’s midterms have received widespread attention, especially for Republicans hoping to take back the House
        of Representatives — former Cranston Mayor Allan Fung and current state Treasurer Seth Magaziner ’06 are vying for Rhode
        Island’s 2nd Congressional District. Close to three-fourths of respondents are planning to vote in the November election
        — 60% are voting in a state other than Rhode Island, 8% are non-Rhode Island residents voting in Rhode Island and 5% are

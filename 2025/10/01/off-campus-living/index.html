            As October arrives, many Brown students hoping to live off campus
            next year have already signed leases around College Hill.
            <br /><br />
            Many of these units are owned by the same individuals, commonly
            nicknamed by students as the “College Hill Landlords.” The Herald
            spoke to three of these landlords to learn more about the off-campus
            housing landscape.

          data-step="2"

          <p>
            The leasing process often begins more than a year in advance of the
            leases’ start dates, landlords say. According to David Baskin, a
            landlord on College Hill, students looking for off-campus housing
            for the 2026-27 school year started signing leases as early as this
            May. <br /><br />
            Baskin owns three buildings near Brown’s campus: 21 Euclid Ave., 165
            Lloyd St. and 159 Lloyd St. Across these three properties, he rents
            to more than a hundred Brown students.<br /><br />
            Bethany Hughes ’10 has 40 students living in her five properties,
            located at 42 John St., 171 Williams St., 173 Williams St., 175
            Williams St. and 208 Williams St. Students began reaching out months
            in advance to inquire about her available properties, she wrote. She
            still gets about 10 emails each week from students looking for
            off-campus housing for next year. <br /><br />
            But it’s now too late — all of her properties are full, she wrote.

            Edward Kazarian, known by his residents as “Ed,” has been a landlord
            for about a dozen College Hill properties over the last 40 years.
            95% of his tenants are Brown students, he said in an interview with
            The Herald.<br /><br />
            Kazarian, Hughes and Baskin all told The Herald that Brown students
            are drawn to off-campus housing for many reasons, including flexible
            layouts, independence and living costs.
          </p>

        <div

          data-step="4"
        >
          <p>
            In Baskin’s experience, students have largely focused on bedroom and
            bathroom layouts when choosing a property, he said.<br /><br />
            When touring off-campus units last year, Vanessa Vu ’26 and her
            roommates often came across “odd bedroom configurations, like
            unequal size of rooms.” The group “toured many places that we didn’t
            end up liking very much.”<br />
            <br />
            Vu eventually leased a five-bed, one-bath unit on John St that her
            and her roommates currently live in.

          data-step="5"
        >
          <p>
            Many students also move off campus in hopes of having their own
            facilities.<br /><br />
            “I wanted to live off campus because I wanted a living space of my
            own, a proper kitchen with modern appliances and an apartment I
            could modify to my liking,” wrote Alp Gurëş ’27, who currently lives
            in a three-bed, two-bath unit in one of Baskin’s properties. He
            signed his current lease last September and has already re-signed it
            for next fall. <br /><br />
            He added that he “really wanted a bidet” — something that would not
            be possible in a dorm setting.<br /><br />
            Students “want to have their own autonomy,” Baskin said.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div
          class="step"
          data-coords="-71.39668090593716,41.82970267975988"
          data-step="6"
        >
          <p>
            Kazarian also shared a similar sentiment, adding that students may
            not want to live “under institutional constraints” as they get
            older. The surrounding neighborhoods become “an extension of
            campus,” since so many friends groups end up living near each other,
            he said.<br /><br />
            “I already knew I wanted to go off campus for senior year for the
            feeling of independence,” Vu wrote, “and I felt like none of the
            existing on-campus options had everything I wanted.” Location
            factors were also important for Vu, who wanted to live on South
            Campus in closer proximity to Wickenden Street and Trader Joe’s.<br /><br />
            “The reason why students like my properties is because (they’re)
            literally on campus,” Baskin wrote, adding that his buildings are in
            a “very safe location” with on-site management. <br /><br />
            “It’s almost like a white-glove service,” he added.

          <p>
            When deciding whether to live on or off campus, a vast majority of
            students consider the cost of both housing and food.<br /><br />
            For the 2025-26 school year, on-campus housing and a 20 Weekly Meal
            Plan cost a total of $18,514 per year, or just over $2,000 per
            month. In comparison, most Brown students living in private
            off-campus housing pay $800 to $1,400 per month, not including the
            cost of food, according to Hughes.<br /><br />
            “It might make economic sense” for students to live off campus,
            Kazarian said. “Up until this past year, the rents have been pretty
            steady.”

            a city-wide property tax increase, but Kazarian said he “tried to
            keep that impact very, very minimal” for students.<br /><br />
            In addition to taxes imposed on landlords, the costs of gas,
            electricity, water and sewage have more than doubled over the past
            five years, according to Baskin, who noted that he also needs to pay
            his employees on top of these expenses. <br /><br />
            “We have kept our rent really low,” said Hughes. She charges renters
            a relatively low monthly rate of $650 to $750 per bedroom “since
            (she) bought in a long time ago,” starting in her junior year at
            Brown.<br /><br />
            These rates, she said, have “kept demand high.”

        <div class="step" data-coords="0,0" data-step="9">
          <p>
            Baskin worries that government policies will force landlords to
            continue raising their rents, he said. He mentioned a proposal put
            forth before the City Council of Providence which, if passed, would
            establish a $300 “<a
              href="https://providenceri.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=15235&MediaPosition=314402.000&ID=49758&CssClass="
              target="_blank"
              >Student Impact Fee</a
            >” for students living off campus. Landlords would have to collect
            this fee from students, and Baskin said landlords “don’t want
            another tax on the students.”<br /><br />
            “We hope the students come together with us and (speak out) against
            this particular ordinance proposal,” he added.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-coords="0,0" data-step="10">
          <p>
            In addition to rising taxes, the landlords of College Hill must
            contend with a frequent turnover rate among renters. “Students don’t
            stay more than a year or two at most,” Kazarian said.<br /><br />
            “Usually about 10% of my students renew” because they’re juniors,
            but the rest are seniors who move out after a year, Baskin said.<br /><br />
            Güreş is among this 10%. “I will have different roommates, but I’m
            so happy to say that I won’t be moving out until May 2027,” he
            wrote.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-coords="0,0" data-step="11">
          <p>
            Though many students only stay for one year, the landlords have
            little to no issues finding new renters. <br /><br />
            For “most of my apartments, the tenants that we get are from
            referrals from existing tenants,” Kazarian said, adding that “a lot
            of it’s word of mouth” as students visit their friends’ apartments
            and express interest in having the spot next year. He sometimes
            refers groups of students to a different landlord if he doesn’t have
            a unit that will work for them. <br /><br />
            Güreş wrote that his apartment building is “so in-demand that you
            kind of need to have an ‘in’ to be able to secure the unit you
            want.” His roommate, who is now a senior, lived in the unit last
            year, so Güreş and his roommates were “prioritized” when signing
            their current lease.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-coords="0,0" data-step="12">
          <p>
            According to these landlords, the outlook of off-campus housing is
            bright. Demand is “definitely not declining,” Kazarian said. “I’ve
            had multiple groups interested in the same quarters,” he added,
            explaining there is often competition for some units.<br /><br />
            Demand has “increased over the past 18 years that I have been
            investing,” Hughes said, and she foresees that this will continue.
            “You cannot beat the college experience of living in an off-campus
            house with several of your friends.”<br /><br />
            “I am super happy with my decision to live off campus and the place
            we have,” Vu said. <br /><br />
            For her, nothing is better than “cooking together with (her)
            roommates and having people over in a homey-feeling space.”

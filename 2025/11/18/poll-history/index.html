                Each semester, The Herald polls about 1,000 undergraduate
                students on topics ranging from national politics and new
                University initiatives to campus relationships and party
                culture. Its list of questions changes in varying degrees each

                President Christina Paxson P’19 P’MD’20 has had a fluctuating
                approval rating since she was inaugurated on Oct. 27, 2012.
                Paxson’s approval rating reached its highest in fall 2017, when
                62% of poll respondents indicated either strong approval or
                general approval of her. That semester, the University had

                    target="_blank">launched</a> the “Brown Promise” initiative,
                aiming to eliminate all

                    support and resources</a> for undocumented students after
                the Trump
                administration ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
                program.

            <br>
            <p>
                But Paxson’s approval rating steadily declined after this peak.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Disapproval of Paxson peaked in spring 2024, when 59% of
                respondents “strongly disapproved” or “disapproved” of the
                University president. Disapproval of the Brown University
                Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, also
                peaked that semester, with over 56% of poll respondents
                disapproving of the Corporation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The semester before, protests had erupted across the country —
                including on Brown’s campus — prompted by the Israel-Hamas war,
                with some student groups calling for the University to divest
                from companies affiliated with Israel. That year, student
                activist groups carried out multiple protests, including two
                sit-ins that resulted in the arrests of 61 total students. In
                February 2024, 19 students had also begun an eight-day hunger
                strike in support of divestment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After The Herald’s Spring 2024 Poll was conducted, around 80
                students began a week-long encampment which ended when the
                Corporation agreed to vote on a divestment proposal. They
                ultimately rejected the proposal in October 2024.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Paxson’s approval rating has modestly rebounded since 2024. In
                The Herald’s Fall 2025 Poll, 34% of respondents approved of the
                University’s president compared to only 25% disapproving.
                Disapproval of the Brown University Corporation has continued to
                decline, with 32% of undergraduates disapproving of the
                Corporation in this semester’s poll.

                Over the last 15 years, approval of the U.S. president has
                declined among poll respondents. Presidential approval peaked
                ahead of the 2012 presidential election, when 78.8% of
                undergraduates approved of former President Barack Obama,
                according to the Herald’s Spring 2012 Poll. Former President Joe
                Biden had more lukewarm reception among Brown students, with
                only 44.2% of poll respondents approving of the former president
                in fall 2023.

                Still, no recent president has had a higher disapproval rating

                After spending its $1.2 million surplus in the 2022-23 academic
                year, the Undergraduate Finance Board <a

                In
                response, the UFB restricted budgets in fall 2023, causing many
                student groups to replan or cancel events and activities.

                In interviews with The Herald at the time, student group leaders
                expressed concerns over how the budget reductions meant they
                would not be able to perform key club activities. In spring
                2024, 36.8% of undergraduate students disapproved of the UFB,
                but its approval rating has bounced back from this low over the

                last semester. Now, only 14.5% of students disapprove of the

                The Supreme Court’s decision was followed by major changes in
                the makeup of Brown’s student body. In the year following the

                Black student enrollment among first-years moderately rebounded
                this academic year, increasing from 7.7% for the class of 2028

                White student enrollment at Brown has steadily declined over the
                past 13 years, according to The Herald’s polling. In fall 2012,
                63.4% of poll respondents identified as white, dropping to 47.3%
                in fall 2025. Polling indicates that Asian student enrollment
                has almost doubled, growing from 20.4% in fall 2012 to 40.3% in
                fall 2025.

                Legacy preferences in Brown’s admissions process have been
                broadly unpopular among the undergraduate student body in recent
                years. Last semester, support for legacy admissions declined to
                15% from a high of 29.6% in spring 2019. But at the same time,
                disapproval of legacy admissions also declined from 66% in
                spring 2022 to 56% last semester.

                    target="_blank">created</a> an ad hoc committee to
                reevaluate Brown’s admissions policies, including the
                consideration of legacy status. The committee announced its
                recommendations in spring 2024, which included reinstating a
                standardized testing requirement and maintaining early decision
                admissions. The committee did not issue a recommendation on the
                future of legacy admissions, seeking further community input.
                The University has not publicly announced any major changes to
                legacy preferences in undergraduate admissions.

                Over the past nine years, legacy enrollment has remained
                relatively constant, according to The Herald’s poll, with around
                15% of undergraduates having a sibling, parent or grandparent
                who also attended Brown.

                Since 2012, Brunonians have changed how they approach
                relationships
                on campus. Compared to previous years, more students at Brown
                are
                single and less are participating in hook ups, according to The
                Herald’s polling.

                48.5% in fall 2012 to 68.7% in fall 2025. At the same time, the
                percentage of students hooking up with multiple people had
                decreased from a high of 12.6% in fall 2012 to a near-low of
                1.5% this semester. The proportion of students in a casual
                relationship has also been more than halved, falling from a high
                of 9.8% in fall 2023 to a low of 4.4% this semester. Still, <a href="https://projects.browndailyherald.com/2025/02/14/mapping-love-on-campus/" target="_blank">love

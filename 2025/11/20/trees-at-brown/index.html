                    In 2018, community members gathered on a rainy afternoon for
                    the
                    funeral of a beloved Angell Street resident: a soon-to-be
                    deceased Fagus sylvatica, or beech tree. The tree was set to
                    be
                    cut down to make way for the Lindemann Performing Arts
                    Center,
                    which eventually opened in 2023.

                    These moments are just two ways Brunonians present and past
                    have
                    expressed their love for College Hill’s leafiest residents.
                    But
                    Brown’s fascination with trees isn’t a recent phenomenon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the mid-20th century, Mary Elizabeth Sharpe P’45 —
                    wife
                    of the University chancellor at the time — gained an
                    interest in
                    landscape architecture while designing the garden for her
                    home
                    at 84 Prospect St., now known as Rochambeau House, according
                    to
                    University Curator Nicole Wholean.

                <p>
                    In the 1940s, Sharpe expanded her passion for landscaping to
                    the
                    wider College Hill community when then-University President
                    Henry Wriston asked her to landscape the area around the
                    newly
                    refurbished University Hall, Wholean added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “But (Sharpe) had a much bigger plan for Brown and decided
                    that
                    a landscape plan could unify all of the disparate
                    architecture
                    styles on campus,” Wholean said in an interview with The
                    Herald.
                    “She was given permission to move forward” but did not have
                    “a
                    budget or staff,” Wholean added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, Sharpe persevered with her landscaping plan,
                    funding the project by soliciting donations from her friends
                    and
                    contributing money to the initiative herself, Wholean said.
                    Sharpe also “encouraged Brown to propagate plants in (its)
                    greenhouses and … donated cuttings from her own azalea
                    plants.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    When deciding what species of trees to plant on campus,
                    Sharpe
                    considered each variation’s hardiness, attractiveness and
                    ease
                    of maintenance. Wholean added that Sharpe also accounted for
                    Providence’s changing seasons, selecting flowering magnolias
                    (genus Magnolia) and dogwoods (genus Cornus) for the spring
                    and
                    holly (genus Ilex) for the winter.

                    <p>
                        Decades later, Grounds Superintendent Nick Mol and Lead
                        Groundsworker and Arborist Mark Lindenberg have
                        preserved
                        Sharpe’s treescaping legacy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mol added that the Grounds Department also considers the
                        existing landscape when planting new trees. If the
                        Grounds
                        Department “were to plant another tree in (the Main
                        Green),
                        we would choose an American elm or a magnolia to
                        maintain
                        the look and feel of the quad,” he wrote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But maintaining the various species of trees on campus
                        requires a careful eye. Mol and Lindenberg explained
                        that
                        the unique sunlight, water and soil needs of each
                        species
                        are considered during the tree management process. The
                        Grounds Department also tracks the health of the trees
                        and
                        “monitor(s) for disease, insect damage and hazardous
                        limbs.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To prevent Dutch Elm Disease from spreading among the
                        numerous American elm trees littered across campus, the
                        Grounds Department has an integrated pest management
                        program. During the early 20th century, Dutch Elm
                        Disease
                        wiped out much of the population of American elms. The
                        species — currently listed as endangered on the
                        International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List
                        of
                        Threatened Species — is the seventh most common tree on
                        Brown’s campus, with 58 American elms lining the College
                        Hill streets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But American elms aren’t the only special trees on
                        campus.
                        An apple tree (Malus domestica) grown from a cutting of
                        the
                        famous apple tree in Sir Isaac Newton’s garden sits
                        right
                        outside the Engineering Research Center. This tree is
                        only
                        one of the 1,232 trees that line the streets of Brown
                        and
                        College Hill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These trees — and the treescape they form — are an
                        important
                        aspect of the first impression the campus makes on
                        students,
                        families and other visitors, according to Mol and
                        Lindenberg. They wrote that the treescape’s “beauty is
                        part
                        of what makes Brown University so special.”

                        Trees also bring numerous health, economic and

                        benefits to Brown.

                        For example, “hospital admissions of kids with asthma …
                        are
                        much higher in low-canopy neighborhoods,” explained

                        Haviland added that trees can prevent wind in the winter
                        season and provide shade in the summer, reducing
                        residents’
                        heat and air conditioning usage.

                        She said that trees can reduce stormwater runoff and
                        mitigate flooding, which is especially important in
                        areas
                        like Providence, which has <a

                        According to Haviland as well as maps from the PNPP’s
                        PVD
                        Tree Plan, the east side of Providence is the greenest
                        part
                        of the city. In Blackstone, for instance, 51% of the
                        neighborhood is shaded by trees — a measure known as
                        canopy
                        cover. College Hill has a lower canopy cover of 34%,
                        while
                        neighborhoods in South Providence have some of the
                        lowest
                        proportions in the city at under 15%.

                        these
                        areas can often see higher temperatures, more flooding

                        higher levels of asthma.

                        Communities around the state are taking steps to improve
                        their treescapes and increase the amount of canopy
                        cover,
                        according to Pauline Cooper ’27.

                        This past summer, Cooper interned in the urban forestry
                        program of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental
                        Management. She said that RIDEM’s street tree
                        inventories
                        were “part of a longer, several-year plan to overall
                        increase urban forestry management” in Warren, North
                        Providence, Woonsocket and other Rhode Island towns.

                        For her internship, Cooper inventoried street trees in
                        North
                        Providence, an area that was “shockingly not diverse” in
                        terms of tree species — especially compared to College
                        Hill.
                        The town “had over 50% maple trees,” Cooper said, adding
                        that “no more than 30%” of trees should be from a single
                        family to prevent the spread of disease.

                        When creating new treescapes, landscapers must also
                        consider
                        the interaction between planted trees and the native
                        environment.

                        Many of the maple trees in North Providence are Norway
                        maples (Acer platanoides), “which is a non-native maple
                        that’s somewhat prone to disease,” Cooper said. Norway
                        maples — which also make up “a large proportion of
                        street
                        trees in Providence” — have been spreading into natural
                        environments and forests in the state, according to
                        Brown
                        Herbarium Director Rebecca Kartzinel, an assistant
                        teaching
                        professor of biology and ecology, evolution and
                        organismal
                        biology.

                    <p>
                        The fifth-most common street tree on College Hill is the
                        Bradford pear, a cultivated variety of the callery pear
                        (Pyrus calleryana). Native to Asia, the Bradford pear is
                        widely considered to be an invasive species — some
                        states
                        have even outlawed it. According to Kartzinel, when the
                        Bradford pear was introduced to the eastern United
                        States
                        the species hybridized with native pear trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “When you have hybridization between Bradford pear and
                        native pear, you can start to get the transfer of
                        Bradford
                        pear genes into the native population and change the
                        composition of the native species” through gene flow,
                        Kartzinel said.

                        Beyond Norway maples and Bradford pears, Brown hosts a
                        plethora of native trees on its campus grounds. The most
                        common street tree on College Hill — the London plane
                        (Platanus x acerifolia) — is a cross between the
                        non-native
                        oriental plane (Platanus orientalis) and the American
                        sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). The native honey
                        locust
                        (Gleditsia triacanthos) and red maple trees (Acer
                        rubrum)
                        are the second and fourth most common on campus,
                        respectively.

                        biloba), an East Asian species of tree endangered in the

      <p>A full WaterFire lighting on the Providence River in 2025 features fires
      blazing in 81 braziers — large, shallow metal stands just above the
      water’s surface. The braziers run from Crawford street to the WaterFire
      Basin in Waterplace Park, spanning around five blocks. Throughout the
      night, fire performers and gondoliers weave their way along the water,
      while visitors mill around at the river’s edge, stopping at food stalls,
      admiring locally crafted art or interacting with living statues.<br /><br />

      But in December 1994, when Barnaby Evans ’75 organized the first
      WaterFire, the event looked very different. <br /><br />

      When Evans attended Brown in the 1970s, the Providence River was buried
      under streets and buildings, Evans told The Herald. In the 1990s, the city
      invested significant resources into uncovering the river. <br /><br />

      On Dec. 31, 1994, Evans created a sculptural art installation dubbed
      “First Fire,” placing and lighting 11 braziers along the river in order to
      attract people to the newly created waterfront and celebrate the 10th
      anniversary of a bygone Providence New Year’s Eve tradition called “First
      Night.” The event, funded out of his own pocket and held without prior
      approval from the city, ran until 1:30 a.m. in the new year, Evans
      recalled.<br /><br />

      WaterFire chose to use pine wood for its spicy scent and distinct crackle.
      A full lighting can go through 15-20 cords of wood — over 30,000 pounds —
      in one night, according to Bob Hopkins, who has volunteered with WaterFire
      since 2008.<br /><br /></p>

      <p>In June 1996 came “Second Fire,” when the then-head of the city’s Parks
      Department offered Evans $990 to run the program during a week-long
      international art conference. “It became viral,” Evans said. “The
      community said, ‘Hey, we’d love you to do this on an ongoing basis.’”<br /><br />

      From there, community members supported the creation of the WaterFire
      nonprofit in 1997 with Evans as the executive artistic director, the role
      he remains in to this day. Over 30 years later, that organization has 30
      employees, 400 annual volunteers and a permanent arts center, along with
      an annual budget of $3.7 million.<br /><br />

      The fires attract nearly 1 million visitors annually, creating $149
      million in local economic output and $9 million in state tax revenue,
      according to the WaterFire website. For funding, the nonprofit relies on
      corporate sponsorships, community donations and, recently, city and state
      support.<br /><br />

      But today, nearly three decades since its founding, WaterFire is
      struggling to stay afloat.<br /><br />

      </button>

      <div id="toggle-content">
        <p>
           Last year, the Boston Globe reported that WaterFire was $750,000 over
      budget in 2023, putting the price tag of each event at $250,000. The fiscal
      year 2026 state budget includes a $400,000 line item grant to
      WaterFire.<br /><br />

      Rising expenses have made lightings more costly, as the organization’s
      annual insurance prices rose to nearly $250,000 in 2024, according to the
      Globe. The organization also has to pay approximately $50,000 per year to
      the city of Providence for event security — previously written off by the
      citypolice details. Since 2023, WaterFire has cut 25% of its staff.<br /><br />

      But the underlying issue seems to be, according to Evans, is a loss of
      revenue. <br /><br />

      Mark Allan, the interim executive director of WaterFire Providence, told
      The Herald that he believes the decrease in funding is symptomatic of a
      yearslong economic trend of companies leaving Providence or scaling back
      support for WaterFire. <br /><br />

      Out of the nine Rhode Island universities that have previously sponsored
      lightings, only the Rhode Island School of Design remains a sponsor, Evans
      said. Earlier this year, Brown stopped sponsoring a Family Weekend
      WaterFire amid budget shortfalls, The Herald previously reported.
      <br /><br />

      WaterFire had around 75 sponsors this year, Kelly Pattison, the director
      of sponsorship and corporate relations, told The Herald. Contributions
      ranged from $250 for an ad to sponsorship of a full lighting. Sometimes
      sponsorship can entail lending chairs or vases — “It takes a village,”
      Pattison said. <br /><br />
      She explained that planning for a lighting is a long, continuous process,
      noting that in late October, she was already lining up donors for next
      year’s lightings. The COVID-19 pandemic “rocked everyone,” she said.
      Corporations became much more cautious about how they spent their money,
      prioritizing seeing a return on their investment. As a result, sponsorship
      has shifted to being more community-based, she said.<br /><br />
      Amid the se rising costs, falling revenue and dwindling sponsorships,
      WaterFire scheduled just six full lightings for this year, a marked
      decrease from nine full lightings in 2024, 2023 and 2022. This year’s
      schedule saw three 30-brazier Basin lightings, as well as two partial
      lightings, which only illuminate a smaller section of the river.
      <br /><br />

      Some city leaders are trying to and state have stepped in andto help.
      The fiscal year 2026 state budget includes a $400,000 line item grant to
      WaterFire. Earlier this year, Mayor Smiley proposed the city purchase the
      WaterFire Arts Center building for $3.5 million and rent it back to the
      WaterFire nonprofit for $1 a year, provided the organization holds eight
      full and five partial lightings a year. On Nov. 4, the City Council
      Finance Committee approved the resolution, sending it to the full City
      Council for a vote on Nov. 20.

      “The scale of the event gives the impression that it’s presented by the
      city or by the state,” Evans said. Visitors do not realize it is a
      nonprofit that handles everything from building the stages for
      performances to adjusting the height of the river for the boats, he
      explained. <br /><br />

      The Herald spoke to staffers, vendors, performers and organizers to see
      what goes into making WaterFire possible.</p>

              <i>Liz Knights, fire performer</i><br /><br />
              Fire performer Liz Knights has been lighting up the Providence
              River as part of WaterFire for over a decade. Knights’s company,
              Cirque de Light, now employs most of the fireball-twirling
              performers on WaterFire boats — and sometimes, Knights performs
              with them, she said.<br /><br />

              Knights’s path to performance began while she was a student at
              Brown, where she joined the juggling club and found a community
              that encouraged her interest in circus arts and gymnastics. After
              leaving school due to illness, she began performing professionally
              and soon crossed paths with WaterFire’s original fire spinner,
              Spogga Hash. After asking him if she could join the act, she
              received a formal invitation from the organizers.<br /><br />

              Since then, Cirque de Light has grown to include over 60 fire
              performers, with about 10 rotating through WaterFire performances
              each season. “They’ll light their fire prop off of one of the
              torches, and then perform in the basin, and then perform going up
              and down the river, which is really fun, because you get to see so
              many different people,” Knights said. <br /><br />

              For Knights, the choreography and spectacle are part of what makes
              the event so rewarding — and surprisingly safe. “People think it’s
              way more dangerous than it is,” she said, adding that she’s gotten
              worse burns from household objects than the fire she performs
              with.
              <br /><br />

              Her favorite part of the night is the sheer beauty of it all.
              “It’s incredibly immersive,” she said. “You're surrounded by the
              audience. You're surrounded by fire and music.”<br /><br />

              Having performed at WaterFire for so many years, it feels “kind of
              like a family,” Knight said. She expressed gratitude that this
              year’s season was able to happen, but worried about the event’s
              uncertain future. “It’s one of those things where people might not
              recognize the effect until it’s gone,” she added.<br /><br />

              “I just like making people happy,” Knights added. “I’m there to
              make them feel joy, awe, wonder. All those things are very
              gratifying.”<br /><br />

              <i>Barry Lima, Staff sergeant </i><br /><br />
              This year’s Nov. 1 lighting featured a “Salute to Veterans” event
              at the basin. Barry Lima Jr., a veteran staff sergeant, was one of
              the torch holders at the ceremony. Around 50 veterans participated
              in this year’s event, lighting the braziers that line the river,
              according to Lima Jr.<br /><br />

              Lima and his wife come down to WaterFire every year, and after
              seeing a call for veterans to perform at the Nov. 1 lighting, Lima
              signed up. The experience was incredibly meaningful, he told The
              Herald. <br /><br />

              Lima recalled taking a photo with his late father at the same spot
              where he lit the torches on Nov. 1. “There’s a picture that I have
              — me and my dad before he passed away — and it was right where I
              was lighting the torches,” he said. “So this place is pretty
              special. You know, with my dad not being here, I think of him a
              lot when I come here,.” Lima said.<br /><br />

              He added that he felt instantly connected to the veteran community
              during the ceremony. “Even just being down there — I didn’t know
              any of them — we all still felt like brothers and sisters.
              Strangers, but like we’ve all been through the same hardship of
              wearing the uniform and all the stuff that we go through.”<br /><br />

              <i>Cathy Tague, owner of Pourever Creations</i><br /><br />

              Cathy Tague is the owner of Pourever Creations, a small family
              business that works with acrylic paint and epoxy to create designs
              on everything from wine glasses to charcuterie boards. Using a
              technique called pour painting, Tague designs primarily
              ocean-themed glassware. <br /><br />

              Pourever Creations started around seven years ago, when Tague’s
              husband suggested that Tague pour epoxy over acrylic paint to make
              a glassy finish. They began selling their creations at local
              crafts fairs and “Small Business Saturday,” an initiative by
              WaterFire to feature local businesses at their arts center.
              <br /><br />

              Since being accepted as a WaterFire vendor, Pourever Creations has
              been at nearly every lighting. <br /><br />

              “WaterFire is, by far, our biggest and best event that we do,”
              Tague said. <br /><br />

              But the preparation process can be complicated, Tague said, given
              that often, vendors only find out if they’ve been selected for an
              upcoming lighting around a month in advance. Since she works with
              epoxy, which can take up to a few weeks to fully set, Tague
              emphasized that it’s “about a month-long process to really get
              things up and going.”<br /><br />

              Tague added that while their ocean designs are most popular, she
              likes to design her products for WaterFire based on the upcoming
              event. For the Veterans WaterFire, she designed red, white and
              blue pieces for sale. <br /><br />

              WaterFire has been crucial for building her business, Tague said,
              as she often gets repeat customers across multiple WaterFires.
              “Every year they come back and get a new gift for someone that
              matches what they brought them last year.” <br /><br />

              She also emphasized “the excitement and energy” of event staff,
              attendees and other vendors. She recalled one rainy WaterFire
              night, when Waterfire staff and vendors tried to help each other
              keep their stalls dry. <br /><br />

              “You’d think it would be the most miserable thing ever, but it’s
              one of our favorite memories,” Tague said. “You build a
              community.”<br /><br />

              Tague expressed concern about the recent decrease in WaterFire
              lightings. “I’m a small business and I rely on WaterFire,” she
              said.<br /><br />

              <i>Selahattin Sep, Tigris Handmade</i><br /><br />

              Selahattin Sep, founder and owner of shoe store Tigris Handmade,
              said that for him, shoemaking is “a family tradition.” His family
              has been making shoes for 700 years, he said, with “no glue, no
              synthetic materials, no machine (and) no electricity.”<br /><br />

              “Everything is made by hand,” he said, explaining that different
              pieces of leather are hand-stitched together to construct the
              shoes.<br /><br />

              This shoe-making method requires at least three days to produce
              five or six pairs. But the shoes he produces last a long time:
              “Six years old and they still look brand new,” Sep said.<br /><br />

              Since the shoes don't use any chemicals, they can also be
              composted. The shoes won’t “end up in the landfill,” he said.<br /><br />

              Since Tigris Handmade doesn’t mass produce its merchandise, Sep
              doesn’t have enough pieces to keep his shop open while he displays
              his work at WaterFire. Despite the effort, he said, “it’s fun to
              be here.” <br /><br />

              “It's not all about making money,” he said, adding that often,
              it’s “not worth it” financially to be part of the event.<br /><br />

              Instead, he continues to come back to WaterFire because of the
              diverse crowds it attracts, he said. He believes that the
              community he builds at these events is sometimes “better than
              money.”<br /><br />

              ><br /><br />

              Paul Octeau is a local beekeeper and owner of Paul & Sandy’s Honey
              Shack, selling raw honey, beeswax candles and honey sticks. He has
              worked as a beekeeper for over 10 years, helping manage 37 hives
              throughout Rhode Island, he told The Herald.<br /><br />

              Octeau said he found out about WaterFire from some of his friends
              who are currently also vendors. <br /><br />

              This is the Honey Shack’s second year as a vendor at WaterFire,
              which he said has been “great for sales.” He said that the Honey
              Shack is accepted to be a vendor at about one WaterFire lighting
              per month. <br /><br />

              Octeau noted the importance of donations for WaterFire, especially
              due to the loss of sponsors. “The more people they can get to
              donate, then they can keep the fires burning,” he added.<br /><br />

            <p>
              <i>Andrew Anselmo, origami</i><br /><br />
              Andrew Anselmo, a mechanical engineer and origami street
              performer, has been folding paper creations at WaterFire for over
              two decades. His journey with origami began “peripherally” as a
              child, but it wasn’t until a university conference in Turkey that
              he discovered the joy of folding for others after being asked by
              attendees to perform origami, he said. <br /><br />

              “And next thing you know, I’m making a couple of bucks,” said
              Anselmo, who is now an origami master and street performer.<br /><br />

              Anselmo first brought origami to WaterFire when he folded peace
              cranes along the canal after the September 11 attacks in 2001. “My
              primary and best gig ever has been WaterFire,” he said. Since
              then, he has returned year after year, driving down from Boston
              with his wooden box and knapsack, quietly folding for hours as
              crowds wander past, absorbing the music and firelight.<br /><br />

              For Anselmo, the performance is about connection, not
              compensation. “You’re interacting with the crowd by giving stuff
              away,” he said. “I’ve got a sign on my little tip jar that says,
              ‘If you can’t leave a tip, leave a note,’ and that allows people
              to interact with you, and they don’t feel guilty if they don’t
              have any money.”<br /><br />

              The reactions he receives are as varied as they are memorable.
              “I've had people say, can you make a ring for me, because I want
              to propose to my girlfriend,” Anselmo said. “I've had people come
              up to me saying, you know, this is my last WaterFire because I got
              cancer and I'm going to be gone.”<br /><br />

              Despite the funding cuts, Anselmo remains committed to the event.
              “You need music. You need paints. You need sculpture … You need
              people doing all sorts of wacky stuff to make life worthwhile,” he
              said.<br /><br /></p>

              <p><i>Tiziano Pardo ’28 & Emily Benitez ’28</i><br /><br />

              For Tiziano Pardo ’28 and Emily Benitez ’28, WaterFire has become
              a defining part of their time in Providence.<br /><br />

              “It’s the one thing I feel like Providence has that’s very
              unique,” Pardo said. “It’s really beautiful seeing how the
              community engages with each other.”<br /><br />

              Benitez said she was drawn to the event’s atmosphere and the sense
              of calm it provides. “I love the water, so being here with the
              fires — I think it’s a nice visual,” she said. “It gives me a
              break from school.” <br /><br />

              Pardo, who attended a recent state budget hearing about WaterFire,
              said he’s concerned about cuts to the event’s funding. “It’s quite
              unfortunate,” he said, referring to statewide budget deficits.
              Pardo highlighted the economic footprint of an event like
              WaterFire, describing how “you’re propping up local vendors, local
              artists, hotels, restaurants.”<br /><br />

              He added that the budget cuts “only (make) it more important for
              private actors like Brown to support the event,” expressing
              disappointment that “Brown didn’t include WaterFire as part of
              Parents Weekend.”<br /><br />

              “I can only hope that they continue doing this,” Benitez said.
              “It’s been a big part of my Brown experience, and I would love to
              keep coming and seeing this.”<br /><br />

              Event-Day Staffer Juliana Craige has been working with WaterFire
              since June of 2023. She primarily works to help unload trucks and
              set up the WaterFire merchandise stand. <br /><br />

              “The amount of work that it takes and coordination with the city
              to make a WaterFire happen is insane,” Craige said, pointing to
              staffers who come to set up early in the morning and the police
              that block off the streets the night before a lighting.
              <br /><br />

              One of Craige’s favorite memories of setting up at WaterFire is of
              a lighting on a rainy day. <br /><br />

              “We got halfway through setup, and it started torrentially
              pouring,” Craige said. From there, she and her bosses brainstormed
              a solution: to pull two trucks onto the street facing one another
              and set up the merchandise tents in the middle. <br /><br />

              “We were working out of the trucks, and everybody was gathering
              under the tents,” Craige said. “It was super hectic, but super
              fun.”

              Angel Winpenny — owner of local eateries The Patio on Broadway and
              the recently acquired Trinity Brewhouse — ran a stall at WaterFire
              where she served alcoholic beverages from both locations.<br /><br />

              “This is an opportunity that we’re thankful to partake in by
              representing our business to the local community,” she said. “We
              like to participate in community events.”<br /><br />

              Events like WaterFire, she added, gives tourists “an idea of what
              the city of Providence has to offer.” <br /><br />

              Winpenny added that a portion of her sales from WaterFire will be
              donated back to the event, noting the importance of doing “all
              that we can to help support” WaterFire. <br /><br />

              She said she finds “a lot of joy” in being part of the event.

              <i>Tara Smith, living statue</i><br /><br />
              Tara Smith, a performance artist and living statue, has spent the
              last 20 seasons bringing WaterFire to life — without moving an
              inch. She “fell into” the craft 21 years ago, she told The Herald,
              starting to busk in her hometown of Bridgetown, Massachusetts.
              <br /><br />

              “I’ve always been a generally artsy person, but living statuary
              and performance art in general has been the art form that really
              gripped my soul,” Smith said.<br /><br />

              Smith started out performing near the Washington Street Bridge, an
              area that wasn’t originally part of the event. But after a few
              years, WaterFire organizers reached out to her, inviting Smith to
              become a formal fixture of the event. <br /><br />

              “It's central to my life at this point,” Smith said. “It’s been
              nice seeing the same people coming to WaterFire year after year. I
              have adults, they’re in their 20s now, talking about seeing me
              when they were a little kid.”<br /><br />

              During performances, she scans the crowd looking for chances to
              connect — with a wave to a child or a gentle gesture to ease
              someone’s nerves. Her characters, Smith said, are pieces of
              herself she “pluck(s) out and put on display… and give them a
              moment to shine.”<br /><br />

              WaterFire’s atmosphere sets it apart from other performance
              events, Smith said. “There is inherently this sort of unwinding at
              the end of the day with something fun,” encouraging reflection and
              small, meaningful interactions, she said.<br /><br />

              For Smith, the WaterFire season provides the bulk of her annual
              income, and she relies on the event not just financially but
              creatively. Smith worries about the event’s future, particularly
              after funding cuts and the slowdown caused by the pandemic. “I
              rely on the WaterFire season to be the bulk of my income for the
              year,” she said. <br /><br />

              But she remains committed. “I have no plans to retire anytime
              soon,” she said. “I’m going to keep performing until my body says,
              ‘No, we can’t do this anymore.’”<br /><br />

              <i>Matt Stone, Gather Glass</i><br /><br />
              Since 2011, Matt Stone has been working with WaterFire as the
              co-owner of Gather Glass, a Federal Hill-based glassblowing studio
              that offers handcrafted products, lessons and more.<br /><br />

              With help from event staff, Gather Glass originally sold “wearable
              necklaces and earrings,” Stone said, along with WaterFire-themed
              glasses. Over the years, Gather Glass’s live demonstrations and
              range of product offerings have evolved and grown.<br /><br />

              WaterFire has “never been anything but wonderful,” Stone said. The
              festival brings together “such a big group of people from such a
              variety of places,” he added.<br /><br />

              On the night of the Nov. 1 WaterFire, winds were gusty and strong,
              making setting up “a little tricky,” Stone said. He and his
              coworkers used “zip ties and sandbags” to anchor their tent and
              demonstration area in place.<br /><br />

              Gather Glass has held live glassblowing demonstrations for its
              entire tenure at WaterFire. Equipped with a mobile furnace, two
              glassmakers often work on a piece at the same time next to the
              sales tent. That piece “could be a vase, or a cup or a bird,” said
              Stone.<br /><br />

              “It’s a dance with the medium, and everyone can be part of
              something special” watching the demonstration, Stone added.
              “Sometimes we’ll have 50, 100 people watching us make a piece.”<br /><br />

              WaterFire is “such an important part of our business,” Stone said.
              The festival provides not only a chance for attendees to purchase
              glass products, but also for people to “learn about who we are”
              and sign up for glassblowing classes, he added.<br /><br />

              The financial boost that WaterFire provides Gather Glass “carries
              over” for “weeks and months beyond” the event,” Stone said. “The
              business that we get from WaterFire is huge.”<br /><br />

              As a whole, WaterFire nights are “so important for the economy and
              the jobs that are here” in Providence, Stone said — not only the
              vendors, but also “the hotels and the surrounding businesses.”
              Despite funding changes throughout the years, Stone emphasized the
              consistency of “really big, fun crowds” that attend the
              festival.<br /><br />

              “It brings this beautiful atmosphere and energy to the city that
              you just can’t replicate anywhere else,” Stone said. “When I think
              of Providence, I think of WaterFire.”<br /><br />

              “Without it, our city would be a lot different,” he added.<br /><br />

              <i>Felicia LaRoche, attendee</i><br /><br />
              Felicia LaRoche, a senior at Rhode Island College, stated that her
              Nov. 1 visit to WaterFire was her “fifth or sixth time” there.<br /><br />

              She expressed enthusiasm for “the live music” and the bustle of
              the event. In particular, LaRoche explained that she regularly
              comes to see Gather Glass’s live glassblowing demonstrations.<br /><br />

              “It’s just really pretty,” she said, watching one of Gather
              Glass’s glassblowers place a sculpture into the kiln. “It’s nice
              art.”<br /><br />

              <i>Joseph Mushipi, visual artist</i><br /><br />

              Hailing originally from Zambia, visual artist Joseph Mushipi has
              been participating in WaterFire since 2002.<br /><br />

              “Nature is the source of my inspiration,” he said. “I paint
              magical trees. I paint leaves. I’m so obsessed with nature.”<br /><br />

              Mushipi describes his experience with WaterFire as simply
              “phenomenal.”<br /><br />

              “I sell my art to a lot of big festivals,” he said. But his
              experience with WaterFire in particular has helped him to “learn a
              lot and improve so much.” <br /><br />

              Especially because of its frequency compared to other festivals
              across New England, the festival has provided him the most
              “exposure,” he said.<br /><br />

              The process of preparing for WaterFire “takes so much work,”
              Mushipi explained. Throughout the year, he has to stay stocked
              with art materials and build a strong inventory of prints. The
              night of the festival, he comes early to set up his booth and
              string lights across the inside.<br /><br />

              “It’s art on its own, just arranging the paintings on the wall,”
              he added. “So I love it.”<br /><br />

              But his work has not come without financial difficulties.<br /><br />

              “Especially this year, sales have gone way down,” he said.
              “Looking at what is happening in the country,” he believes that
              more people are choosing to spend their money on basic necessities
              such as food.<br /><br />

              “But I signed up for this,” he added. “Two paintings, or prints,
              whatever comes out of it — you just say, ‘Thank God for that.’”<br /><br />

              During WaterFire nights, Mushipi’s booth often grows extremely
              crowded. The event formally ends at 10:00 p.m., but Mushipi says
              that he usually stays until 11:00 p.m. to connect with lingering
              attendees.<br /><br />

              “Watching people walk past, I see a lot of sad faces,” he said.
              “But the moment they come close to my art, their face changes. The
              customer came very sad, and he goes home very happy. I want to
              achieve that.”<br /><br />

              <i>Tommy Tainsh, Good Vibes</i><br /><br />

              Tommy Tainsh, owner of beverage company Good Vibes, said that he
              and many of his coworkers “have worked for other companies that
              have done WaterFire … for probably 30 years.” He noted that the
              event has “really obviously grown” since he first worked there as
              a vendor.<br /><br />

              In the late 1990s, Tainsh said, “they used to have a little dance
              floor” at WaterFire. <br /><br />

              But Good Vibes is a new company, Tainsh noted. “This is our first
              summer, and it’s been great,” he said.<br /><br />

              Their WaterFire menu advertised several seasonal offerings,
              including a hot apple cider with caramel whiskey and a spiced fall
              sangria. At the events they cater, Tainsh said, “we try to bring a
              little bit of everything.”<br /><br />

              He said that Good Vibes tries “to do something a little extra
              special” for each event — for WaterFire that day, the company had
              “glow-in-the-dark ice cubes,” he said. <br /><br />

              The company also sells several locally sourced beers, since for
              the last three decades, Tainsh has worked as a brewer. “We support
              a lot of local breweries, because it’s tough in this day and age,”
              he said.<br /><br />

              Preparing for the event takes weeks, Tainsh noted. For WaterFire,
              Good Vibes made 50 gallons of hot apple cider.<br /><br />

              In catering, Tainsh added, Good Vibes model its approach after the
              company name: they “bring the positive energy and hope for the
              best.”<br /><br />

              “It seems like a five hour event, but it's more like a three week
              event,” he joked, adding that “it’s worth the effort, because when
              you have people and they enjoy what you bring ... that's all you
              could ask for,” he said.<br /><br />

              WaterFire is “huge” for local businesses, Tainsh said. “Not
              everybody goes out anymore ... the new generation stays in,” he
              added, but WaterFire “is an excuse to come out.”<br /><br />

              Tainsh said there may be a silver lining despite funding cuts:
              Rarer WaterFire lightings might attract more visitors. “If you
              have one every week, maybe as many people won't come,” he said.
              <br /><br />

              At Good Vibes, Tainsh works with his wife Carlene, his sister
              Colleen and his friend Tony — who he described as “like a brother”
              to him.<br /><br />

              “We’re not just here to make money,” he said. “We’re here as a
              family.”<br /><br />

              <b>At the WaterFire Circle Tent:</b><br /><br />
              At WaterFire, “we don't have any fancy seats by the river where
              you get the best view. We don't sell seats on a boat to ride
              because it's meant to be seen by everybody from the shore,” Evans
              told The Herald.<br /><br />

              WaterFire does, however, offer boat rides to members of the
              WaterFire Circle, their “most generous supporters.” <br /><br />

              WaterFire Circle offers both individual and corporate membership
              plans. The lowest individual plan, which grants the purchaser 16
              WaterFire Circle tickets, costs $1,500. The pricier gold plan
              costs $5,000, granting the purchaser 30 tickets and the right to
              reserve a private boat ride, according to their website.<br /><br />

              Circle members also have access to the WaterFire Circle reception
              tent, a private seating area with refreshments, beverages and a
              private fire dancer show.<br /><br />

              <i>Jeanine Palumbo, volunteer with WaterFire Circle</i
              ><br /><br />

              Since 2007, Jeanine Palumbo has volunteered at WaterFire. She
              currently works at the welcome tent for the WaterFire Circle,
              which consists of individual and corporate sponsors that help to
              support WaterFire. <br /><br />

              She said that the WaterFire Circle aims to make up for the recent
              decrease in donations for the event. While the state and city
              contribute funds, “it’s nowhere near what it takes to put on a
              WaterFire,” she said. <br /><br />

              Palumbo said that people can become “members” of the WaterFire
              Circle, which allows them entry into the reception tent. “It’s the
              only place that you can have access to our wooden boats, where you
              can go in amongst the fire.” <br /><br />

              Palumbo emphasized that while WaterFire is still struggling with
              their sponsorship, individual donations have become even more
              important. “It certainly isn’t going to affect the deficit we have
              in a big way, but it will all add up,” she added. She said that
              WaterFire does not charge an entry free, which allows the broader
              Providence community to participate in the event.<br /><br />

              This year marks the first season Chill’s Cheesecakes has been a

              Chill’s Cheesecakes bakes out of a shared kitchen space in Warren,
              Rhode Island, which is where the business heard about WaterFire,
              Hill said. <br /><br />

              “It’s been a really steady, nice source of income for us,” Hill
              added. <br /><br />

              Though it’s only his first year, Hill said that he’s aware of the
              recent lack of sponsors for WaterFire, and that maintaining the
              event is crucial. <br /><br />

              “It’s really unique,” Hill said. “And to have it go away, I think
              that would be very disappointing.” <br /><br /></p>

              Nov. 1 WaterFire to enjoy the last full lighting of the season.<br /><br />

              Constancio added that she volunteered at WaterFire briefly while
              she lived in Providence. “It was great meeting people in the
              community and just seeing the energy and artistry that went into
              it,” she said. She said that she wants WaterFire to persist,
              despite the recent financial struggles. <br /><br />

              “Big businesses and small businesses in the area thrive from the
              amount of people that it brings in,” Constancio said. “It’s done
              nothing but positive things in all these years, so it’s sad to see

              Sarah Voykovic began volunteering with WaterFire in June. On the
              night of the Nov. 1 lighting, she was stationed at “Starry, Starry
              Night,” an art installation that suspends visitors’ wishes from
              light-up blue stars by Hemenway’s Restaurant to raise funds for
              WaterFire.<br /><br />

              Voykovic explained that the Star Field offers several different
              types of products, including “little trinkets” with names like
              “dream orbs” and “dreamworms.” However, the main attraction is the
              dozens of stars hanging from the trees.<br /><br />

              “People can take a ribbon, and then they write their wish on it,”
              Voykovic explained. “Then one of our team members will go and hang
              it in the Star Field, wherever the person chooses.”<br /><br />

            “I wanted to create an artwork that was about celebrating the values
            of community,” Evans added. “I wanted to make an artwork that didn't
            involve cynicism, that didn't involve irony, and it was absolutely
            welcoming to everybody, no matter what their level of understanding
            about the arts.”<br /><br /></p>

            <p>Amid its financial challenges WaterFire is increasingly courting
            wealthy donors to keep the fires burning, according to Mark Allan,
            the interim executive director of WaterFire Providence. While Evans
            understands that this strategy is also employed by museums, operas,
            ballet companies and other arts organizations, he emphasized that
            “WaterFire is not a piece about the elite.”<br /><br />

            “It’s about welcoming absolutely everyone of any means, from the
            homeless to the art professor to students, to (new) immigrants, to
            people who just wander in on the way home from the beach,” Evans
            said.<br /><br /></p>

            <p>Having been at WaterFire for almost two decades, Palumbo said she
            has experienced many wonderful moments with the community, visitors
            and guests.<br /><br />

            “There aren’t many situations where you can come out with a diverse
            group of people from all over the world to enjoy something in a
            peaceful, magical setting,” Palumbo said. “Between the music, the
            fires and the sounds, it ignites all of your senses simultaneously
            and shows Rhode Island in its best light.” <br /><br />

            “The scale of the event gives the impression that it's presented by
            the city or by the state,” Evans said. Visitors do not realize it is
            a nonprofit that handles everything from building the stages for
            performances to adjusting the height of the river for the boats, he
            explained. <br /><br />

            When asked by The Herald about his hopes for the future of
            WaterFire, Evans said that he has many ideas for expanding the
            event, such as creating a torch ceremony for Brown’s graduation.
            <br /><br />

            “We have hundreds of ideas of things we’d like to try,” Evans said.
            “We’d love to bring back some of the new ideas we’ve never done, but
            we can’t do any of them without funding.” <br /><br />

            For Evans, creating WaterFire was a “fascinating experiment,” going
            from lighting fires with borrowed boats to developing an entire crew
            of people to make the event function.<br /><br />

            “I don’t think I ever imagined 31 years later we would still be
            doing it,” Evans said.<br /><br />

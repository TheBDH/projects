                The Corporation — Brown’s highest governing body since 1764 — is
                primarily responsible for long-term strategy, overseeing Brown’s
                financial health, reviewing major policies impacting the campus
                community, accepting gifts and selecting University presidents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group, currently composed of 51 individuals, typically meets
                behind closed doors three times a year. The only publicized
                insights from these meetings are notes released in the following

            <h3>How is the Corporation structured?</h3>
            <p>
                The Corporation has a bicameral structure formed by two branches
                — the Board of Fellows and the Board of Trustees — that formally
                gather every February, May and October.
            </p>
            <p>
                While trustees do not meet without fellows present, fellows meet
                more regularly and hold additional responsibilities in
                University administration such as “adjudging and conferring the
                academical degrees,” according to the University’s <a
                    href="https://corporation.brown.edu/sites/default/files/documents/charter-of-brown-university_08312020.pdf"
                    target="_blank">charter</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each Corporation member must serve on one main committee —
                Committee on Academic Affairs, Committee on Budget and Finance
                or Committee on Campus Life — and can choose to join other
                standing committees, subcommittees and ad hoc committees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditionally, the Corporation has 42 trustees and 12 fellows
                elected for six- and 11-year terms, respectively. Of these
                trustees, 13 are chosen by alums in an agreement between the
                Corporation and the Brown Alumni Association.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two new alumni trustees are elected by current Brown students in
                their final year of study and alums within five years of
                graduating, according to the <a
                    href="https://corporation.brown.edu/about-corporation"
                    target="_blank">Corporation’s website</a>. The remaining
                trustees, along with all of the fellows, are elected internally
                by the Corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, the Corporation has 36 trustees, 10 fellows,
                President Christina Paxson P’19 P’MD’20, Chancellor Brian
                Moynihan ’81 P’14 P’19, Vice Chancellor Pamela Reeves ’87 P’22,
                Secretary Richard Friedman ’79 P’08 and Treasurer Earl Hunt ’03.
            </p>
            <p>
                All Corporation positions are unpaid volunteer positions with
                the exception of Paxson, who also serves as Brown’s president.

                Seventeen members, a third of the Corporation, have a background
                in finance or investing. All hold or have held prominent
                leadership positions, and at least seven have founded or
                co-founded financial companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                A significant responsibility of Corporation members is to
                protect “the long-term institutional assets of the University,”
                set the budget and tuition and establish salary pools, according
                to the Corporation website.

                Trustee Joe Dowling previously served as Brown’s chief
                investment officer and the CEO of Brown’s endowment. Under

                    target="_blank">leadership</a>, the endowment grew to a
                then-record high of $4.7 billion and was the best-performing
                endowment in the Ivy League. Fellow Jim Yong Kim ’82 P’22 also
                formerly served as the 12th president of the World Bank from
                2012 to 2019 and the 17th president of Dartmouth from 2009 to

                members attending institutions in the Northeast. Of the
                Corporation’s 51 members, 41 graduated from Brown. Other

            <h3>Political donations</h3>
            <p>
                Since the early 2000s, Corporation members have donated over $8
                million dollars to political campaigns and initiatives, with
                donations to Democratic representatives topping out at $5.9
                million, according to data publicly released by the Federal
                Election Commission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fellow Robert Goodman ’82 P’18 P’24 made the largest donations,
                including $2.7 million to Democratic initiatives and just over
                $100,000 to initiatives not affiliated with either the
                Democratic or Republican parties. Gregory Penner, chairman of
                the board of directors of Walmart, trails him with a total of
                $934,000. A majority of Penner’s donations made to political
                initiatives were not affiliated with either major party. Penner
                also donated the most out of any Corporation member to
                Republican political initiatives, spending $430,435 according to
                FEC data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Members donated over $80,000 to then-Vice President Kamala
                Harris and former President Joe Biden’s 2024 campaigns. No
                direct donations were made in support of the Trump campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                Goodman, Guow, Johnson, Penner, Dowling and Friedman did not
                respond to a request for comment regarding their political
                donations.

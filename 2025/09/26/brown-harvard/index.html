            <p>
                On Saturday, the Brown football team will travel to Harvard
                Stadium, seeking their first road win against Harvard this
                century. As Brunonians head north on the commuter rail or I-95
                to follow the Bears to Boston, they might wonder how Brown has
                historically performed in this storied matchup.
                <br><br>
                The answer? Poorly.
                <br><br>
                Last year, the Bears <a
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/09/for-the-first-time-in-14-years-brown-football-defeats-harvard"
                    target="_blank">stunned</a> the Crimson, stealing a
                game-winning touchdown in the final 30 seconds of the game to
                clinch their first victory against Harvard in 14 years. This
                Saturday, they’ll attempt to secure their first back-to-back win
                in 26 years, and after last weekend’s massacre against
                Georgetown, there’s reason for hope. During the Bears’
                season-opening 46-0 shutout against the Hoyas, Brown flexed an
                electric offense and suffocating defense. It was the Bears’
                largest margin of victory since 1949, and the 18th-largest
                margin of victory in the history of Bruno football.
                <br><br>
                So after a historically strong first game of the season, the
                Bears will try to turn the page to a new age of competitive
                football this Saturday at 6 p.m. But with decades of dominance
                in their back pocket, the Crimson have other plans. Will Brown
                keep the momentum going, or was last year’s win just a fluke? It
                all relies on Head Coach James Perry ’00 and his seemingly
                revamped football squad.
                <br><br>
                The storied Brown-Harvard rivalry is, admittedly, one-sided. As
                Perry told The Herald, Harvard’s “rival is Yale.”
                <br><br>
                But this unilateral dynamic opens up an opportunity for Brown to
                “play this game on our terms,” Perry said. “We love it. And if
                they don’t view it the exact same way, that’s fine.”
                <br><br>
                Below is an in-depth breakdown of the entire history of the
                Brown–Harvard rivalry, from 1893 to the present.

                The Bears’ first rival was not Harvard, but Dartmouth, according
                to Brown Athletics Archivist Peter Mackie ’59. “Brown and
                Dartmouth were not big enough or powerful enough to compete with
                Harvard and Yale, so they created their own rivalry which was
                really, really intense,” Mackie said.
                <br><br>
                But at the same time, the games between Harvard and Brown
                continued in 1894 with two face-offs that year — the only time
                the two teams have faced off twice in one regular season. The
                first game that year saw Bruno’s first touchdown against the
                Crimson after a 60-yard run by quarterback William Hopkins,
                class of 1897. But Brown still lost the game 4-18. At the time,
                touchdowns had different point allowances.
                <br><br>
                The second game of the year was highly anticipated by students.
                “All the team are anxious to meet Harvard again and will
                undoubtedly play a game which will not in any way lower Brown’s
                reputation on the football field,” The Herald wrote prior to the
                game.
                <br><br>
                Despite high hopes, Brown lost to the Crimson yet again. <a
                    href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:973023/"
                    target="_blank">A
                    Herald contributor</a> complained of the referee’s
                decisions,
                writing that “his most conspicuous unfair decisions were made
                when Harvard was most in need of them” and “even the most
                enthusiastic Harvard supporters exchanged knowing looks.”
                <br><br>
                From 1893 to 1913, Bruno suffered 21 consecutive losses to the
                Crimson. No game was played between the two schools in 1904,
                when <a

                    target="_blank">Harvard’s manager said Brown’s team was too
                    strong</a> to “play
                late in the season,” The Herald reported. Bruno had suffered a
                harrowing 0-29 loss to the Crimson the year before.

                <br><br>
                To celebrate ending the losing streak, first-year students were
                sent to gather wood for a bonfire. The Crimson gifted the Bears
                the game ball, which was presented in a ceremony with then-Brown
                President William Faunce, class of 1880.</div>

                Two years later, the Bears finally had their first
                victory. Running back Fritz Pollard, class of 1919 and later the
                first Black head coach in the NFL, helped lead Brown to its
                first triumph over Harvard. Pollard “changed the trajectory of
                Brown football,” Mackie said.
                <br><br>
                At that 1916 game, the stadium was “just packed with people,”
                Mackie said. “Pollard ran wild in that game.”
                <br><br>
                “From every point of view, Fritz Pollard was the feature player
                of the game,” The Herald wrote at the time. “His spectacular
                work on offence and defense brought the 32,000 people in the
                stands to their feet time and again, and it may be said with
                truth that without Pollard the final score would have been
                decidedly different.”
                <br><br>
                According to Mackie, Harvard used to claim that they played
                their second string against Brown in the early 1900s games.
                “That was an issue that really rankled Brown because it had
                signaled they really didn’t respect us,” Mackie said.

                In 1917, World War I began to impact Brown football, Mackie
                said. No game was played that year, since Harvard did not have a
                formal team. Bruno got their second-ever win in 1918 against a
                weakened Crimson.

                A 30-acre athletic complex was constructed in addition to the
                stadium, Mackie noted. These improved facilities “put Brown on
                the athletic map.”

                substitutions, Mackie said. The group was subbed out in the last

                A student at the time, Mackie remembers that era well — Brown
                bested Harvard in all four games played during his time as an
                undergraduate. The team saw a lot of support: “Everybody went to
                the games on Saturdays,” he recalled.
                <br><br>
                But soon after, the Bears encountered “a lot of problems,” he
                added.
                <br><br>
                In the 1960s, Brown football was at a low point. “It was so
                embarrassing for me as a recent” alum, Mackie said. At that
                time, Brown had no real rival. Any victory would’ve been a good
                victory, Mackie explained.
                <br><br>
                In an email to The Herald, Dewey Moser ’64 P’90 wrote that
                Brown’s only victory over Harvard during his football career was
                at a separate first-year-only game in the fall of 1960.
                <br><br>
                Moser recalled teammate Anthony Matteo’s ’64 mother attending
                the game. “After showering and changing we got on the bus and
                Matteo’s mom showed up with boxes of Italian sandwiches and
                goodies. That made the ride back to Providence even more
                satisfying.”

            <div class="article">
                At that 1976 Harvard-Brown game, ESPN sportscaster Chris Berman
                ’77 — a former Herald writer and then-radio announcer for
                Brown’s team — got into a blow-up argument in the press box at
                Harvard Stadium, Mackie said.
                <br><br>
                “I remember how psyched I was after we won. Then I overheard
                their radio guys saying how ‘lucky’ Brown was,” Berman said in
                an interview with GoLocalProv. “So, I reached my boiling point
                and pinned the two of them up against the wall and made them
                admit that we weren’t lucky. They did, and that was that.”
                <br><br>
                In the 1980s, Steve Harrison ’90 came to Brown from West
                Virginia to play varsity football. The rivalry against Harvard
                was fierce during Harrison’s time at Brown, especially with
                Bruno’s head coach John Rosenberg being a Harvard alum.
                <br><br>
                “When I was there, that was probably the game we most wanted to
                win,” he said. The crowd at Harvard-Brown games tended to be
                bigger, according to Harrison, likely because of the two
                schools’ proximity.
                <br><br>
                While Brown did not take home a victory against the Crimson
                during Harrison’s time on the team, he looks back fondly on the
                1988 game. Bruno’s kicker was injured, so Harrison went to his
                coach and asked to sub in. “That was the first game I kicked in
                college,” he said. “I was two-for-two on my extra points.”

                To Mackie, this is when the Harvard-Brown rivalry finally felt
                mutual. “They really respected and feared us,” Mackie said.
                “Fear is an important ingredient in football.”

                In 2000, scheduling changes made the Harvard-Brown game both
                teams’ Ivy League opener. Before that, Brown had been sandwiched
                between other Ivies on Harvard’s schedule, Mackie said.
                <br><br>
                “The place in the schedule has a big impact on that tradition,”
                Mackie said.
                <br><br>
                Perry agrees. In addition to kicking off the season, the game
                tends to occur before the bone-deep cold of fall sinks in.
                “There’s kind of a hoopla around it being good weather,” Perry
                said.
                <br><br>
                And, at the end of the day, Harvard is just a “fun place to
                hate,” Mackie added. “There’s that aura around Harvard that
                draws people.”

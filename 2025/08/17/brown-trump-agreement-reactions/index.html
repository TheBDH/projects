        <h3>Community reactions to Brown’s agreement with the Trump administration</h3>
        <p class="blurb"> 
            On Wednesday, July 30, Brown <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/07/brown-reaches-deal-with-federal-government-to-restore-research-funding">reached</a> a deal with the Trump administration to restore the University's federal research funding in exchange for a number of concessions. The University agreed to distribute $50 million over 10 years in state workforce development grants, provide admissions data to the federal government and adhere to <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/news/2025/2/6/media-center-ncaa-announces-transgender-student-athlete-participation-policy-change.aspx">NCAA</a> rules for the participation of transgender athletes in intercollegiate sports, which state that only students assigned female at birth can participate in women’s sports, among other terms.<br/><br/>
            Over the past few weeks, The Herald solicited reactions from community members — students, alumni, parents, staff — to show how those affiliated with Brown are feeling about the settlement. The Herald has compiled a collection of over 30 letters, published below.

                On Saturday, a tragedy shook Brown’s campus.
                <br><br>
                Two students were killed, and nine others were injured in a mass
                shooting that occurred in Barus and Holley. In the aftermath,
                the Brown and Providence communities have shown up for one
                another — providing shelter and meals to students and raising
                money for victims.
                <br><br>
                The Herald spoke to members of the community who supported one
                another, both on the night of the incident and in the days that
                followed.

                <h3>‘They sacrificed their own safety’: Providing shelter during
                    lockdown</h3>
                As news of the shooting spread across campus Saturday afternoon,
                several local businesses took students in, offering them shelter
                and food.
                <br><br>
                After being alerted of an active shooter, the staff at Ceremony
                — a popular cafe and teahouse — dimmed the lights, pulled the
                curtains down and flipped chairs onto tables, according to
                Cheyenne Gansell, Ceremony’s sales and marketing specialist.
                <br><br>
                For the next several hours, eight students and five employees
                sheltered in place in the Ceremony basement.
                <br><br>
                Once the lockdown was lifted, Gansell and other employees drove
                students home. Some employees housed students overnight. “I
                think it was really important to be there in community, with the
                community, for the community,” she said.
                <br><br>
                The next day, one of the students who had sheltered in the
                Ceremony basement stopped by the store to buy one last matcha
                before she went home, and to thank the employees for hiding her,
                Gansell said.
                <br><br>
                Coffee Exchange, a local coffee shop, took in about 30 people on
                Saturday night, most of them students, according to Owner
                Charlie Fishbein. The store turned all the lights off once the
                alert was sent out, and students hid in the bathroom and the
                back stairwell.
                <br><br>
                “We were in the dark for seven hours,” Fishbein told The Herald,
                describing how everyone was quiet, passing the time on laptops
                and phones or by reading books. “The atmosphere was surreal,” he
                added. Taste of India, a restaurant across the street, provided
                food later in the evening, which was served “buffet-style with a
                flashlight,” Fishbein said.
                <br><br>
                When students and staff began to leave the coffee shop at around
                11 p.m., Fishbein made sure everyone had a ride and a place to
                go.
                <br><br>
                Students who took shelter in the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center
                were met with support from several non-profit organizations.
                <br><br>
                Julia Antony ’26, who was working at the OMAC when the shooting
                happened, noted that most students there “hadn’t eaten in hours”
                and that “it was really comforting” when volunteers from
                non-profit groups showed up.
                <br><br>
                “The fact that they were there and they sacrificed their own
                safety to help us was really admirable,” Antony said.
                <br><br>
                Over the course of the weekend, Red Cross volunteers provided
                food and refreshments for over 1,500 people, including
                “students, faculty and local responders,” according to a
                statement sent to The Herald from the American Red Cross
                Connecticut and Rhode Island Region.

                <h3>‘A source of stability’: Community members open homes to
                    students </h3>
                Many Brown faculty and staff also opened their doors to students
                in need.
                <br><br>
                Vio Diniz, a cashier with Brown Dining Services for over 20
                years, was at home when the University alerted her of the
                shooting. She welcomed several Brown students into her home
                until the shelter-in-place order was lifted. Some stayed the
                night.
                <br><br>
                “Brown students, they are like my kids,” she said.
                <br><br>
                When the shooting occurred, Associate Professor of History
                Jeremy Mumford was in the middle of leading a HIST1976V:
                “History of Childhood” seminar of about 12 students at his home.
                Rather than proctoring an exam during that time slot, Mumford
                had opted to host the class for a final discussion and dinner.
                <br><br>
                As soon as they learned of the attack, Mumford and his wife,
                Professor of Biology, Data Science and Computer Science Sohini
                Ramachandran, told students they could stay the night at their
                house.
                <br><br>
                “My daughter, who’s 12, was very interested in making sure that
                everyone had a comfortable bed,” Mumford said, recalling how she
                “gave her bed” to students and “went around making up a bed on
                the couches.”
                <br><br>
                Because there wasn’t enough space in the couple’s house to
                shelter everyone, Ramachandran called a neighboring professor to
                take in half of the students. Friends of students in the class
                who “didn’t have anywhere to go” also arrived later at the house
                to take shelter, according to Mumford.
                <br><br>
                Ellia Sweeney ’21 MD’25 called her friends who were still
                students, offering her family’s home in Cranston to “whoever
                needed a place to stay that night.” Three students took her up
                on her offer.
                <br><br>
                “The night was harrowing,” Sweeney said. Instead of sleeping,
                she stayed up sending text messages checking in on her friends
                at Brown.
                <br><br>
                The following night, when it was announced that the detained
                person of interest was released, Sweeney sent out another wave
                of messages saying her home was open. A total of 10 people came
                over for dinner, and three stayed the night. She drove them to
                the airport the following morning.
                <br><br>
                “I can’t be prouder to be part of the Brown community,” Sweeney
                said, expressing her appreciation for those who helped students
                with transportation and housing.
                <br><br>
                Others, like Adjunct Lecturer of Visual Arts Susanna Koetter,
                offered to drive students to the airport on Sidechat, an
                anonymous online forum for college students.
                <br><br>
                “I want to be a source of stability for my students, for all the
                students,” Koetter said.

                <h3>‘It’s a small gesture’: Donating time and resources</h3>
                The Undergraduate Council of Students opened a community
                assistance form, which received over 2,000 responses as of
                Monday evening, according to UCS President Talib Reddick ’26.
                <br><br>
                Most of the responses have been from alums, parents and
                community members offering financial support, rides, housing and
                other supplies, he said.
                <br><br>
                The idea for the form was proposed by First-Year Representative
                Cindy Sun ’29, who has been “really leading the charge in terms
                of monitoring everything,” according to Reddick.
                <br><br>
                Sun said she first got the idea after her roommate’s mom offered
                her a ride and a place to stay. “I realized that I was really
                lucky to be part of a community,” Sun told The Herald. “I wanted
                to make sure that the people who didn’t have that…would be able
                to get a ride, a place to stay, food if they needed it.”
                <br><br>
                “People everywhere” — including Brown alumni and community
                members at Columbia, Yale and Tufts — have offered support via
                the form, Sun said. Some mental health professionals have also
                reached out to offer counseling services via the form, she
                added.
                <br><br>
                Reddick also worked with Uber and Lyft to provide community
                members on campus with discount codes for travel.
                <br><br>
                “Our hearts are with the Brown University community,” said
                Senior Public Policy Manager at Lyft Brendan Joyce. “It’s a
                small gesture, but we hope a meaningful gesture to help folks
                with their transportation needs during this difficult time.”

                <h3>‘Exemplifies the spirit of Brown’: Raising funds for victims
                    and survivors</h3>
                Samira Umurzokova, the sister of Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, one
                of the students who was killed during the shooting, began a
                GoFundMe that raised over $490,000 as of Wednesday. The GoFundMe
                aims to help with “expenses the family will have to face,” the
                description reads. Any remaining donations will go toward a
                charity in his name.
                <br><br>
                Another GoFundMe, organized by Tiffany Netto MD’27, raised
                nearly $87,000 to support the hospitalized victims’ medical
                bills. “I am completely floored by how quickly money was
                raised,” Netto said.
                <br><br>
                The fundraiser is currently paused as Netto is working with
                President Christina Paxson P’19 P’MD’20 and deans at Warren
                Alpert Medical School to distribute the funds.
                <br><br>
                “I think this fundraiser really exemplifies the spirit of
                Brown,” Netto said. Despite being in a city, she said the
                University has a “small town community feel.”
                <br><br>
                Students and alumni have also raised funds for the victims and
                students trying to get home.
                <br><br>
                Autumn Wong ’25 — an alum living in Miami who started the Bruno
                Flight Fund GoFundMe — raised over $20,000 to assist with any
                additional travel costs for students departing campus early.
                Wong said she has been able to cover the cost of 22 flights as
                of Tuesday, and is working on getting in touch with Delta and
                American Airlines to rebook students’ flights.
                <br><br>
                Wong was a Meiklejohn and Community Coordinator as a student,
                and she said she began reaching out to her former residents and
                advisees who are still at Brown when she heard the news. She
                started covering flights for students out of pocket, and once
                she “drained” her savings account, she started the GoFundMe to
                offset her personal costs and cover more flights.
                <br><br>
                “I hope the students just feel really supported,” she told the
                Herald, adding that “it’s probably a great stress relief to
                (not) have to worry about one more thing and just focus on
                getting back to their families.”

                <h3>‘Support and comfort’: Sharing meals and kind words</h3>
                Andrea Capotosto, senior director of finance, operations and
                analysis at the School of Public Health, gave out “free mom
                hugs” outside the Sharpe Refectory the day after the shooting.
                <br><br>
                She was inspired by seeing “someone doing free dad hugs at a
                pride event a couple years ago,” she said. “I just saw the
                reaction of the people who were there, and I just found it so
                moving.”
                <br><br>
                “If my children were far away from me and they were scared, I
                would want someone else to do what I did,” she continued. “I
                wanted to remind people that for every tragedy that happens,
                there’s goodness out there, and people that want to help,” she
                added.
                <br><br>
                Inside the Ratty, Brown community members came together to
                support victims of the shooting through a poster-making station
                that Daniel Soto Parra ’28 helped manage. Students wrote
                messages of support on posters for their peers recovering in the
                hospital.
                <br><br>
                In a message to The Herald, Soto Parra thanked everyone who
                contributed to the posters, adding that they were delivered to
                Rhode Island Hospital later that day. Soto Parra also started a
                petition calling on Brown to require ID swipes for all
                University buildings at all times. The petition had over 800
                signatures as of Wednesday.
                <br><br>
                “It should be how we come together as a community, rather than
                the violence, that defines this event,” he said. “There is no
                darkness that love cannot turn into light.”
                <br><br>
                Kabob and Curry, a restaurant on Thayer Street, gave all
                students — and any community member who asked — a free meal on
                Sunday. Madhav Basnet, one of the managers, said he was “very
                happy to serve” the Brown community.
                <br><br>
                About 120 students came by for a free meal, according to Basnet.
                He checked to make sure everyone who ate at the restaurant had a
                safe place to go after, and offered free food for them to take
                home.
                <br><br>
                “Brown is very close to us. This is our kind of community,” he
                said.

                “That has been extremely helpful, just knowing that I have a
                community behind me,” he said in an interview with The Herald.
                “And that’s the community that I love and will support and

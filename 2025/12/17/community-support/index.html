                On Saturday, a tragedy shook Brown’s campus. Two students were
                killed and nine others injured in a mass shooting that occurred
                in Barus and Holley. In the aftermath, the Brown and Providence
                communities have stepped up for one another, from sheltering
                students to feeding them to raising money for victims.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here’s how communities have joined forces to ensure the safety
                and wellbeing of everyone on College Hill since the incident.

                <h3>Providing shelter and comfort while sheltering in place</h3>
                As news of the shooting spread across campus Saturday afternoon,
                several businesses in the area took students in, offering them
                shelter and food.
                <br><br>
                After hearing the sirens, eight students and five employees took
                shelter in the basement of Ceremony, according to Cheyenne
                Gansell, the sales and marketing specialist for the tea shop.
                <br><br>
                The staff dimmed the lights, pulled the curtains down and
                flipped the chairs onto the tables, sheltering in place for the
                next several hours. “We grew up knowing that that is what you do
                in America when guns or gun violence happens,” Gansell said.
                “You go and hide.”
                <br><br>
                Once the lockdown was lifted, Gansell and other employees drove
                students home, while some even housed students for the night.
                <br><br>
                “I think it was really important to be there in community, with
                the community, for the community,” Gansell said. She described
                how one of the students who had sheltered in the basement came
                by the store to buy one last matcha before she went home,
                thanking the employees for hiding her.
                <br><br>
                Coffee Exchange, a Providence coffee shop, took in about 30
                people on Saturday night, most of them students, according to
                Owner Charlie Fishbein. He described how all the lights were
                turned off once the alert was sent out, and students were hiding
                in the bathroom and back stairwell.
                <br><br>
                “We were in the dark for seven hours,” Fishbein told The Herald,
                describing how everyone was quiet, passing the time on laptops
                and phones or reading books. “The atmosphere was surreal,” he
                added. Taste of India, a restaurant across the street, provided
                food later in the evening, which was served “buffet style with a
                flashlight.”
                <br><br>
                Students and staff began to leave the coffee shop at around 11
                p.m., and Fishbein added he made sure everyone had a ride and a
                place to go.
                <br><br>
                Students who took shelter in the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center
                were met with support from several non-profit organizations,
                including the Red Cross.
                <br><br>
                Over the weekend, Red Cross volunteers provided food and
                refreshments for over 1,500 people, including “students, faculty
                and local responders,” according to a statement from the
                American Red Cross Connecticut and Rhode Island Region in an
                email to The Herald.
                <br><br>
                Julia Antony ’26, who was working at the OMAC when the shooting
                happened, noted that most students there “hadn’t eaten in hours”
                and “it was really comforting” when volunteers from non-profit
                groups showed up.
                <br><br>
                “The fact that they were there and they sacrificed their own
                safety to help us was really admirable,” Antony said.

                <h3>‘Like my kids’: Housing students on the night of December
                    13</h3>
                Many Brown staff and professors also opened their doors to
                students in need.
                    <br><br>
                “Vio” Diniz, who has been a cashier with Brown Dining
                Services for over 20 years, was at home when she heard about the
                shooting through an email alert from the University. After
                learning that two students from a family she knew was on campus,
                Diniz said she invited them and other students to stay at her
                home until the shelter in place order was lifted.
                    <br><br>
                “Brown students, they are like my kids,” she said.
                    <br><br>
                Associate Professor of History Jeremy Mumford was in the middle
                of leading a
                HIST1976V: “History of Childhood” seminar of about 12 students
                at his home when the shooting occurred. Mumford and his wife,
                Professor of Biology, Data Science and Computer Science Sohini
                Ramachandran, told students they could stay the night at their
                house.
                    <br><br>
                “My daughter, who’s 12, was very interested in making sure that
                everyone had a comfortable bed,” Mumford said, recalling how she
                “gave her bed” to students and “went around making up a bed on
                the couches.”
                    <br><br>
                Because there wasn’t enough space in the couple’s house to
                shelter all the students, Ramachandran called a neighboring
                professor to take in half of the students. Friends of students
                in the class who “didn’t have anywhere to go” also arrived later
                at the house to take shelter, according to Mumford.
                    <br><br>
                Sweeney, who graduated from Brown in May but lives in Rhode
                Island, offered her family’s home in Cranston to whoever needed
                a place to stay that night. Three students took up her offer.
                “The night was harrowing,” Sweeney said. She recalls sending
                hundreds of text messages checking in on her friends at Brown,
                and did not sleep.
                <br><br>
                The following night, when it was announced that the person of
                interest detained in the shooting was released, Sweeney sent out
                another wave of messages saying her home was open. A total of 10
                people came over for dinner, while three ended up staying the
                night. Sweeney drove them to the airport the following morning.
                “I can’t be prouder to be part of the Brown community,” Sweeney
                said, expressing her appreciation for those who “couldn’t be
                here on the scene” but were still “giving rides, helping out,
                housing people.”
                <br><br>
                Others, like Adjunct Lecturer of Visual Arts Susanna Koetter,
                offered students seeking to return home a ride to the airport
                through Sidechat, an anonymous online forum for college
                students.
                    <br><br>
                “I want to be a source of stability for my students (and) for
                all the students,” Koetter said.

                <h3>‘It’s a small gesture’: Donating time and resources</h3>
                The Undergraduate Council of Students is running a community
                assistance form which has received over 2000 responses as of
                Monday evening, according to UCS President Talib Reddick ’26.
                Most of the responses have been from alumni, parents and
                community members offering financial support, rides, housing and
                other supplies.
                <br><br>
                The idea for the form was proposed by First Year Representative
                Cindy Sun ’29, who has been “really leading the charge in terms
                of monitoring everything,” according to Reddick.
                <br><br>
                Sun said she first got the idea after her roommate’s mom offered
                her a ride and a place to stay. “I realized that I was really
                lucky to be part of a community,” Sun told The Herald. “I wanted
                to make sure that the people who didn’t have that, maybe didn’t
                really know the people in their dorm building or have someone
                they could reach out to for help, I wanted to make sure that
                they would be able to get a ride, a place to stay, food if they
                needed it.”
                <br><br>
                “People everywhere” — including Brown alum and community members
                at Columbia, Yale and Tufts — have offered support via the form,
                Sun said. Some mental health professionals have also reached out
                to offer counseling services via the form, she added.
                <br><br>
                Beyond the form, Reddick worked with Uber and Lyft to provide
                community members on campus with discount codes for travel.
                <br><br>
                “Our hearts are with the Brown University community,” said
                Senior Public Policy Manager at Lyft Brendan Joyce. “It’s a
                small gesture, but we hope a meaningful gesture to help folks
                with their transportation needs during this difficult time.”

                <h3>‘Exemplifies the spirit of Brown’: Raising funds for victims
                    and survivors </h3>
                Samira Umurzokova, the sister of Mukhammad Umurzokov, one of the
                victims who was killed during the shooting, began a GoFundMe
                page which raised nearly $490,000 as of Wednesday to help with
                expenses the family will have to face. Any remaining donations
                will go towards a charity in his name.
                    <br><br>
                Another fundraiser managed by Tiffany Netto MD’27 raised nearly
                $87,000 in a GoFundme to support the medical bills of
                hospitalized victims. “I am completely floored by how quickly
                money was raised,” Netto said.
                    <br><br>
                The fundraiser is currently paused as Netto is working with
                President Christina Paxson P’19 P’MD’20 and deans at Warren
                Alpert Medical School to distribute the funds.
                    <br><br>
                “I think this fundraiser really exemplifies the spirit of Brown
                and how, despite it being a big school in a big city, it really
                does have a small town community feel,” Netto said.
                    <br><br>
                In the days following the shooting, students and alumni began
                efforts to raise funds for the affected victims and students
                trying to get home.
                    <br><br>
                Autumn Wong ’25 — an alum living in Miami who started the Bruno
                Flight Fund GoFundMe — raised over $20,000 to assist with any
                additional travel costs. With these donations, Wong said she has
                been able to cover the cost of 22 flights as of Tuesday, and is
                working on getting in touch with Delta and American Airlines to
                rebook students’ flights.
                    <br><br>
                Wong, who was a Meiklejohn and Community Coordinator as a
                student, began reaching out to her former residents and advisees
                who are still at Brown when she heard the news. She started
                covering flights for students out of pocket, and once her
                savings account was drained, decided to start a GoFundMe to
                recuperate the cost and cover more flights.
                    <br><br>
                “I hope the students just feel really supported,” she told the
                Herald, adding that “it’s probably a great stress relief to
                (not) have to worry about one more thing and just focus on
                getting back to their families.”

                Andrea Capotosto, senior director of finance, operations and
                analysis at the School of Public Health, was at home when she
                heard about the shooting.
                    <br><br>
                Capotosto, who gave out “free mom hugs” outside the Sharpe
                Refectory on Sunday, was inspired by seeing “someone doing free
                dad hugs at a pride event a couple years ago,” she said. “I just
                saw the reaction of the people who were there, and I just found
                it so moving.”
                    <br><br>
                “If my children were far away from me and they were scared, I
                would want someone else to do what I did,” she continued. “I
                wanted to remind people that for every tragedy that happens,
                there’s goodness out there, and people that want to help,” she
                added.

                Daniel Soto Parra ’28, who started a petition to require ID
                swipes for all University buildings at all times, shared this
                sentiment.
                    <br><br>
                “It should be how we come together as a community, rather than
                the violence, that defines this event,” he said. “There is no
                darkness that love cannot turn into light.”

                <h3>‘Support and comfort’: Sharing meals and kind words</h3>
                Kabob and Curry, a restaurant on Thayer Street, gave all
                students — and any community member who asked — a free meal last
                Sunday. Madhav Basnet, a chef and waiter at the establishment,
                said he was “very happy to serve” the Brown community and for
                the opportunity “to help.”
                <br><br>
                About 120 students came by for a free meal, according to Basnet.
                He checked to make sure everyone who ate at the store had a safe
                place to go after, and offered free food for them to take home.
                “Food matters,” he said.
                <br><br>
                Inside the Ratty, Brown community members came together to
                support victims of the shooting through a poster-making station
                that Soto Parra helped manage. Students
                wrote messages of support and encouragement for their peers
                recovering in the hospital on the posters.
                <br><br>
                In a message to The Herald, Soto Parra thanked everyone who
                contributed to the posters, adding that they were delivered to
                Rhode Island Hospital later that day.

                Joseph Oduro ’25.5, a teaching assistant for ECON0110:
                “Principles of Economics” who witnessed the shooting, expressed
                gratitude for peers who have provided “support and comfort” to
                him in the days following the tragedy.
                <br><br>
                “That has been extremely helpful, just knowing that I have a
                community behind me,” he said in an interview with The Herald.
                “And that’s the community that I love and will support and
                continue to try my best to protect at all costs.”

                “Continue to lean on your brothers and sisters,” he said.
                “That’s going to be the best way moving forward, and feeling
                that support and feeling that love to really just be able to
                thrive on campus once again.”

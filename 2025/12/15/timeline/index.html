          Smiley confirmed in a press conference that two people had passed away, and the eight other victims in critical but stable condition were being treated at Rhode Island Hospital. “We do not have a shooter in custody at this time,” he added.<br/><br/>
          In the same press conference, Providence Deputy Chief of Police Timothy O’Hara stated that preliminarily, the person of interest identified was “a male dressed in black.” According to O’Hara, the man’s route to enter Barus and Holley was unknown, but he exited on “the Hope Street side” of the building. He urged people to take the continued shelter-in-place order “very seriously.”

          In a second press conference, Smiley announced that an additional person was injured by shrapnel in the attack, bringing the total victim count to nine. The additional victim was expected to make a full recovery. He added that the shelter-in-place order remained in effect for both “campus and the neighborhood surrounding the campus.”<br/><br/>
          Paxson confirmed that the two individuals who passed away, as well as the nine injured, are all Brown students.<br/><br/>
          “Over 400 officers” were in the area, “assisting with both the investigation and to ensure the safety of the Providence community,” Smiley said. He added video footage of the suspect would be shared at the conclusion of the press conference.<br/><br/>
          O’Hara added that the surveillance video of “who we believe is the suspect leaving that area” showed a man “walking on Hope Street and taking a right on Waterman, towards the water.”<br/><br/>
          The man was described as wearing “dark gray or black clothing” and a “camouflage gray mask.”<br/><br/>
          O’Hara stated that “students that barricaded themselves” inside buildings and called police had been “removed” by security forces. The students were “now in a reunification center,” he said.

          A campus alert announced that law enforcement had established a perimeter around the University enclosing the Sciences Quad, Wriston Quad, Main Green, Keeney Quad and Ruth Simmons Quad, among other areas of campus. The alert stated that authorities would enter non-residential buildings within the perimeter “to escort all individuals to safe locations outside of the perimeter.”<br/><br/>

          The Herald, along with several other news outlets, received a surveillance video that showed a man wearing black clothing walking east at the intersection of Hope and Waterman streets, away from Barus and Holley.

          In another email to the Brown community, Paxson announced that students were being evacuated on RIPTA buses. She advised students sheltering in residence halls and off-campus residences to stay in place. Given the campus-wide lockdown, she also encouraged parents and families not to travel to Brown’s campus.<br/><br/>
          She also provided an update from the hospital, stating that six students remained in critical but stable condition. One student was in critical condition, another student was in stable condition and a third had been discharged. “This is an unimaginably tragic day,” she wrote.<br/><br/>

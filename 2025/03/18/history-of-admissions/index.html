          <p>
            Phyllis Beck ’49 P’74 arrived on Brown’s campus in fall 1945 — nearly 80 years ago. Standing out in her memory is the image of people celebrating the United States’ victory in World War II, after Japan signed a surrender document on Sept. 2 of that year.<br/><br/>
            Beck was enrolled at <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2023/04/end-of-an-era-exploring-the-legacy-of-pembroke-college">Pembroke College</a>, Brown’s women’s college that <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/history/timeline/men%E2%80%99s-and-women%E2%80%99s-colleges-combine">merged</a> in 1971 with the College, Brown’s undergraduate program.<br/><br/>
            Pembroke’s academic requirements included gym classes, something not required of the men at Brown. Among the <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1089186/PDF/">classes</a> offered were horseback riding, gymnastics, ice hockey and soccer. <br/><br/>
            Beck went to high school in New York City, took the SAT — although she didn’t remember her score — and completed “short answer” questions for her application to Brown. <br/><br/>
            Beck passed away on March 3 at the age of 97.

                The Class of 1944 <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/history/timeline/first-american-indian-graduate">included</a> Brown’s first Native American graduate, Albert Anthony. Additionally, in the 1940s, Brown <a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/history/timeline/veterans-college-established">started</a> its Veterans Extension Division, a two-year program for veterans admitted under the G.I. Bill of 1944, which provided educational benefits for former members of the armed services. In 1942, a <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:963635/PDF/">plan</a> to allow freshmen to enter at three separate points each year went into effect, and Brown also <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:963620/PDF/">allowed</a> high school juniors “of superior ability” to be admitted. In the 1945-46 academic year, classes at Brown <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:969279/PDF/">became</a> co-ed due to wartime low enrollment.

        <p>
          Carol Agate ’55 was born in Providence. “Brown was so much a part of life,” Agate recalled. Her sister also attended Pembroke.<br/><br/>
          Agate did not remember much about Pembroke’s application process, but she was certain of one thing: “I definitely was not interviewed.” Prospective Pembroke students from at least the class of 1956 onwards were <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1088606/PDF/">interviewed</a> as part of the admissions process.<br/><br/>
          Agate, who studied physics, said she was “very active” as a writer for the Pembroke Record, the college’s student newspaper. “I was really more interested in the Pembroke Record than academics,” she said.

            In 1952, a record amount of financial aid was <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:981711/PDF/">given</a> to the class of 1956, aiding 30% of incoming freshmen. In 1953, the “ideas” curriculum was <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1018212/PDF/">inaugurated</a> at Brown, allowing students to study ideas rather than traditional subject matter tied to a single discipline. In 1958, IC courses were <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1018212/PDF/">required</a> of underclassmen. The program was <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:983680/PDF/">discontinued</a> in 1963. In 1959, Pembroke College <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1090340/PDF/">admitted</a> Early Decision applicants for the first time.

        <p>
          Larry Gross ’63 grew up in the Glover Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C. He attended a public high school in D.C. <br/><br/>
          “In those days, Brown was not as difficult to get into,” Gross said. And when he arrived on College Hill, the academic difficulty was “not as high as I expected it to be,” he added.<br/><br/>
          In 1966, Pembroke College <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1092263/PDF/">saw</a> the highest ratio of applications to seats available among the Seven Sisters — seven of the nation’s highly prestigious women’s colleges.<br/><br/>
          Leila Heckman ’66, hailing from Bridgeport, Connecticut, said that only 10% to 20% of her graduating high school class went to college. She was the valedictorian of her class.<br/><br/>
          Gross was the editor of his high school newspaper and followed the honors track in high school. He said he “had no counseling assistance at all” when applying to college.<br/><br/>
          Initially, he “knew zero about Brown” and “wanted to go to a small school” — like Amherst College, Wesleyan University or Hamilton College.<br/><br/>
          But given his father’s service in the Navy, Gross was enticed to apply to Brown’s Navy Reserve Officers’ Training Corps unit, and was admitted as a midshipman. <br/><br/>
          Gross remembers scoring around a 1400 on his SAT, out of a possible 1600 points. Heckman said she “definitely took the SATs” and “did well enough to get accepted early to Brown.” She also recalls writing “maybe a paragraph” as a writing sample for her application.

In 1969, students <a href="https://slaveryandjustice.brown.edu/history#:~:text=In%20November%201969%2C%20students%20led,1971">boycotted</a> class in protest of the University’s affirmative action program, which they said was insufficient. The Open Curriculum was also <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2023/04/adoch-history-of-open-curriculum">founded</a> in 1969.

        <p>
          Ken Miller ’70, a professor emeritus of biology at Brown, grew up in Rahway, New Jersey, while his father attended classes at Rutgers University. <br/><br/>
          “I would flip through his books on electronics and astronomy,” Miller said. “He would take me to Rutgers basketball games.”<br/><br/>
          For Miller, college was always in the picture. “I was a really smart kid,” he said. He became familiar with Brown through a catalog the University sent him in 1965 after he wrote a postcard to the admissions office.<br/><br/>
          Joseph Silverman ’77, now a professor of mathematics at Brown, recalled taking a “road trip with three friends” during the spring of his junior year of high school, where they “visited Yale, Brown, (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Harvard.” Brown seemed the “happiest” of the four, he wrote.<br/><br/>
          When Miller toured Brown, he was left “very impressed,” he wrote. “I liked the old campus, sort of the Ivy-League feel.” Miller was valedictorian, student body president and a varsity swimmer at his high school. He swam competitively at Brown.<br/><br/>
          Silverman remembers filling out a paper application that needed to be submitted to his guidance counselor “weeks before the application deadline.” He noted that “Brown required the essay to be handwritten,” without the use of a typewriter.<br/><br/>
          Waiting for the admission decision was painful, Silvermann recalled. Every day, he would arrive home from school and check the mailbox.<br/><br/>
          When Miller gets together with his old classmates from Brown decades after their graduation, “all that anybody ever talks about is how we couldn’t possibly get in today,” he said.

In 1972, the Committee on Admission and Financial Aid <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:985846/PDF/">approved</a> a proposal to send successful female applicants an additional letter apart from the traditional acceptance letter, encouraging them to enroll. The University also began <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:985002/PDF/">accepting</a> spring transfer students for the first time. <br/><br/>
              In 1975, students <a href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2023/11/browns-history-of-student-protests-demonstrations-sit-ins">occupied</a> University Hall to protest limited matriculation and recruitment of faculty and students of color. In 1976, Brown began <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1026901/PDF/">using</a> the Common Application, streamlining the application review process. After Brown <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:987205/PDF/">faced</a> housing shortages with the entrance of the class of 1976, University admissions also reduced the size of the 1977 freshman class. <br/><br/>
              In 1977, University admissions <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1027518/PDF/">destroyed</a> 27,000 admissions files after a student attempted to access their admission file through the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. <br/><br/>

          Gordon was raised in the Boston suburbs in a family of Harvard graduates. But she was attracted to the “funky” and “progressive” nature of Brown’s student body and loved the Open Curriculum and sense of independence that came with Brown.<br/><br/>
          For her application, she wrote a creative essay that was “not cookie-cutter,” she recalled. She asked her drama teacher, a Brown alum, to write her a letter of recommendation.

          Ramos remembers writing one essay for Brown, which she printed out and sent in the mail. She also interviewed with an alum in San Juan.<br/><br/>
          She was admitted to “several” Ivy League schools. Penn offered her a better financial aid package than Brown, but Brown agreed to match Penn’s financial aid offer after she met with a member of the financial aid office.<br/><br/>
          “What really attracted me (to Brown) was the ability to choose my own curriculum,” Ramos said. “I wanted to be at the helm of my own education.”<br/><br/>
          She praised Brown for offering “so much support” academically during her four years on campus, during which she found that “some of the courses were very challenging.”<br/><br/>
          But “there were plenty of (teaching assistant) hours” and “opportunities to get one-on-one attention,” she recalled.

          At Brown, Chin explored journalism, acting and modern culture and media. He met John Krasinski ’01 in an acting class. He also worked for the student radio, WBRU, as an alternative rock DJ, producer, voice actor and web designer.

                In October 2012, Kendrick Lamar released his sophomore album,
                “good kid, m.A.A.d. city” to widespread acclaim. Just six months
                later, the rising rap star took the Spring Weekend stage, which
                was <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2013/04/spring-weekend-delivers-engaging-lineup">described</a>
                by a former Herald writer as “a rare combination
                of genre innovation and genuine star power.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Lamar has become one of the most successful Spring Weekend
                performers, garnering numerous accolades and headlining the
                Super Bowl halftime show two times after his performance at
                Brown: once at the Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles alongside
                former Spring Weekend performers Snoop Dogg and Anderson .Paak,
                and another time at the <a target="_blank"

                    LIX</a> in New Orleans earlier
                this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lamar is just one of numerous Spring Weekend artists who have
                gone on to have some of the most successful careers in music.
                His visit in 2013 marked the 63rd annual Spring Weekend, which
                has become one of the most anticipated events of the year for
                Brunonians.
            </p>
            <p>
                The roots of Spring Weekend can be traced back to Junior
                Promenade in 1898, which evolved into All-Campus Weekend after
                World War II. In 1950, the modern Spring Weekend was born and
                the Brown Concert Agency was founded in 1960, tasked with
                bringing up-and-coming artists to campus. In honor of Spring
                Weekend’s 75th anniversary this Saturday, The Herald took a look
                back at the artists who defined past Spring Weekends by
                analyzing Billboard charts, Grammy awards and more.

                Lamar (SW 2013) leads previous Spring Weekend performers on the
                Billboard Hot 100 with a total of 830 weeks on the chart over
                the
                past 13 years. In fact, Lamar is currently on top of this week’s
                chart with “Luther” — a collaboration with SZA — marking his
                sixth
                chart-topper on the Hot 100. Five other songs by Lamar also
                appear
                on this week’s chart, including “Not Like Us.”

                James Brown (SW 1968) comes in at a distant second with a total
                of
                645 weeks on the Hot 100 chart, including his entries with the
                Famous Flames. When Brown, an R&B artist, performed at Spring
                Weekend in 1968, “the crowd pulsated, clapped out the beat,
                danced
                sitting down, danced standing up,” <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:1024405/PDF/">according</a>
                to a former Herald

            <p>
                Other notable guests at the 1968 Spring Weekend concert included
                singer Dionne Warwick — who places sixth for Hot 100 entries
                among
                former Spring Weekend performers with a total of 550 weeks — and
                poet and social activist Allen Ginsberg. This was not the first
                —
                nor the last — time Spring Weekend featured non-musicians.
                Comedians
                were commonplace in early Spring Weekend concerts and civil
                rights
                activist Martin Luther King Jr. even visited in 1967.

                Third place for weeks on the Hot 100 is infamous rapper Sean
                “Diddy”
                Combs (SW 2011), who performed at the 2011 Spring Weekend
                concert
                with R&B singers Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper as the group
                “Diddy
                – Dirty Money.” Diddy — with a total of 637 weeks — has five No.
                1
                hits on the Hot 100. Since his performance on College Hill, the
                rapper has faced widespread criticism and public scrutiny. In
                2024,
                Diddy was <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kjxd3m528o">arrested</a>
                on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking,
                among other accusations. The rapper is currently awaiting trial
                and
                is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fourth place, Atlanta rapper Young Thug (SW 2017) has amassed
                619
                weeks on the chart. His biggest songs include “Havana” with
                Camila
                Cabello and “Go Crazy” with Chris Brown, which spent a full year
                charting on the Hot 100. Close behind in fifth place is Snoop
                Dogg
                (SW 2010) with 616 weeks on the chart with hits like “Drop It
                Like
                It’s Hot” featuring Pharrell and “California Gurls” with Katy
                Perry.

                Some other notable names in the top 25 include English guitarist

                The Yardbirds member, Eric Clapton (SW 1985), rapper Nas (SW

                Lamar also leads past Spring Weekend performers in terms of
                Grammy nominations, receiving a whopping 57, making him one of
                the most nominated rappers of all-time. Lamar has also garnered
                some of the most prestigious awards in music, including a
                Pulitzer Prize for his album “DAMN.” and an Academy Award
                nomination for his song “All the Stars” with SZA from the movie
                “Black Panther.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Lamar is tied with rock band U2 (SW 1983) for the title of the
                Spring Weekend performer with the most Grammy wins, each earning
                22 throughout their musical careers. The band has had
                considerable success with their live performances, with their
                360° Tour between 2009 and 2011 becoming the highest-grossing
                and most-attended concert tour of all-time upon its completion.
                Unfortunately, a Herald reporter <a target="_blank"

                the concert decided to
                go to Newport instead, upset that the performance was held
                indoors in Meehan Auditorium when the temperature outside was 77
                degrees.

                Bruce Springsteen (SW 1974) comes in second place with 20 Grammy
                wins out of 51 nominations. His other accolades include an
                Academy Award, the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential
                Medal of Freedom.

                Singer-songwriter Bob Dylan (SW 1964, 1997) takes fourth place
                on
                the list with 38 Grammy nominations and 11 wins. In 2016, Dylan
                received the Nobel Prize for Literature, the only Spring Weekend
                performer with that distinction. He is one of at least 20
                artists to
                perform at multiple Spring Weekend concerts, while rock band
                NRBQ
                has performed a staggering five times on campus in 1974, 1978,

                Numerous Spring Weekend performers have also won Grammy Lifetime

                Jefferson
                Airplane (SW 1970), The Band (SW 1970) and Grandmaster Flash (SW

                Although Spring Weekend has generally been a domestic affair —
                with
                267 artists coming from the United States — there have been
                multiple
                international artists, especially in recent years.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 1959 Spring Weekend concert saw the first international
                artist,
                featuring Italian big-band leader Ralph Marterie (SW 1959) and
                his
                orchestra.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn’t until almost a decade later that the next
                international
                artists visited Brown’s campus for Spring Weekend. The 1968
                Spring
                Weekend concert had not one, but two rock bands from the United
                Kingdom: Procol Harum (SW 1968) and The Yardbirds (SW 1968).
                Just
                one year later, Spring Weekend featured yet another
                international
                artist — flamenco artist Carlos Montoya (SW 1969) from Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than the UK, which 18 Spring Weekend artists — including
                rapper M.I.A. (SW 2008) — call home, the international country that
                produces the second-most Spring Weekend artists is Canada, with
                nine. Meanwhile, Jamaica comes in at number three with four
                artists:
                Toots and the Maytals (SW 1982, 1989), Pablo Moses (SW 1985),
                The
                Wailers Band (SW 1988) and Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers
                (SW
                1990).
            </p>
            <p>
                Japan and Chile have each sent two artists to Spring Weekend,
                with
                Rina Sawayama (SW 2018) and Mitski (SW 2019) hailing from the
                former, and Nicolas Jaar ’12 (SW 2011) and Elyanna (SW 2024)
                from
                the latter.

                New
                York or California, with 66 and 44 artists, respectively. New

                place,

                Pennsylvania has been home to 14 Spring Weekend performers,

            As the music tastes of the general public have shifted over the
            decades, so have the genres represented at Spring Weekend. The very
            first iterations of Spring Weekend featured orchestral performances
            led by jazz musicians, including pianists Elliot Lawrence (SW 1950,
            1957) and Teddy Wilson (SW 1952).
        </p>
        <p>
            With the revival of folk music and the advent of counterculture came
            the dominance of folk and rock music at Spring Weekend concerts in
            the 1960s and 1970s. Rock artist Janis Joplin (SW 1969)
            “electrified” attendees at a Spring Weekend concert that was
            attended by dozens with forged tickets, according to a 1969 <a target="_blank" href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/storage/bdr:964519/PDF/">edition</a>
            of The Herald. Other performers during this decade included Bonnie
            Raitt (SW 1972, 1978) and Atlanta Rhythm Section (SW 1979).
        </p>
        <p>
            The 1980s saw the continued popularity of rock but the appearance of
            fewer folk artists on the Spring Weekend stage. Rap and alternative
            music, the two genres with the most representation at recent Spring
            Weekend concerts, first appeared during the 1980s. Alternative rock
            band R.E.M. (SW 1985) and rapper Afrika Bambaataa (SW 1985) are some
            other notable performers during this decade.
        </p>
        <p>
            The domination of rap and alternative music started during the
            Spring Weekend concerts of the 1990s and 2000s. Brown students
            enjoyed performances of artists including Coolio (SW 1996), Busta
            Rhymes (SW 1999), They Might Be Giants (SW 2001) and Lupe Fiasco (SW
            2008).
        </p>
        <p>
            R&B started gaining ground in the 2010s, with artists such as
            Childish Gambino (SW 2012), Erykah Badu (SW 2017) and Daniel Caesar
            (SW 2019) making appearances on the Spring Weekend stage. But rap
            and alternative artists have continued to dominate in recent years.
            Artists such as Fetty Wap (SW 2016), Mitski (SW 2019), Phoebe
            Bridgers (SW 2021) and Doechii (SW 2023) have all visited the campus
            within the past decade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other genres that have made an appearance at Spring Weekend include
            blues — popular during the late 1970s — and dance/electronic, which
            peaked during the EDM phase of the 2010s. In addition, the 1990s saw
            the popularity of two genres originating in Jamaica: ska and reggae.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although popular among the general public and constantly on the
            radio, both country and pop have rarely been represented at Spring
            Weekend concerts. Only four country artists and 15 pop artists have
            been at Spring Weekend in its 75-year-long history.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this Saturday’s Spring Weekend concert, rap is the most
            represented genre, with Zack Fox, JT and Offset planned to make
            appearances on the Main Green. Meanwhile, Ravyn Lenae brings some
            genre diversity to this year’s concert with her R&B-inspired music.

                Since President Trump returned to office in January, his
                administration has leveraged billions in federal research
                funding in
                an attempt to <a target="_blank"

                    higher education</a>. Freezes and cuts have hit
                highly selective institutions that the administration sees as
                violating civil rights laws — and Brown is no exception.
            </p>
            <p>
                On April 3, the White House confirmed to The Herald that the
                federal
                government <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/04/trump-administration-set-to-freeze-510-million-of-browns-federal-funding-nyt-reports">plans</a>
                to freeze $510 million in Brown’s federal funding.
                Since that day, researchers have not been reimbursed for
                expenses
                from National Institutes of Health grants, according to an April
                23
                email sent from the Division of Research to researchers and
                obtained
                by The Herald.
            </p>
            <p>
                Staff at the NIH were <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/04/nih-funding-brown-university">instructed</a>
                to freeze all grants awarded to
                Brown and other universities, according to an internal email
                reviewed and verified by The Herald. The email told employees
                not to
                “provide any communication to these schools about whether or why
                the
                funds are frozen.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, at least $8 million in federal grants at Brown have
                been
                cut by the Trump administration, The Herald previously <a
                    target="_blank"

                Gender- and diversity-related terminology were cited as the
                reason
                for these cuts.
            </p>
            <p>
                With cuts rolling in over the past month, more grants are likely
                to
                be at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Herald’s data desk dove into federal and institutional data
                to
                understand how research is funded at Brown, and the possible
                implications recent federal developments will have on College

            </p>
            <p>
                In 2023, Brown spent over $353 million in research and
                development
                expenditures — a stark increase from 2017, the start of Trump’s
                first term — where they spent $212 million. Data from 2023 is

                The appropriations for federal research grants are typically set
                through a budget from the president, which is voted on by
                Congress,
                according to Vice President for Research Greg Hirth ScM’87
                PhD’91.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Right now, that budget hasn’t been set for the coming years,”
                Hirth
                said, explaining the budget is on “a continuing resolution,
                where
                they basically take the money agreed on from a previous time and
                just forward that same amount of money to the future.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “But there’s wiggle room with that, and with all the things
                going on
                in Washington, D.C., there’s more uncertainty,” he added.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finding a grant is mostly the responsibility of the principal
                investigator of a research project, according to Hirth. Most
                researchers are exposed to the grant application processes as
                graduate students when they work with their advisors.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The Division of Research has a whole office where (the staffs’)
                job
                is to make sure that your grant is compliant with all the
                regulations that you’re sending it to,” he said. “The person
                writing
                the grant will work with their department, typically, and then
                the
                department will interface with the administration in the
                research
                office.”
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, the Office of Sponsored Projects sends the
                application
                to the funding agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2024, Brown submitted 1,710 grants and 821 of them were
                funded —
                meaning around half of submitted grants were approved, according
                to
                Hirth, who added the national average of grants approved is
                around
                30%. But he noted these numbers can fluctuate depending on the
                field
                of research.

                Half of Brown’s R&D expenditures in 2023 came from life
                sciences,
                according to the NCSES survey. Social sciences came second at
                12%,
                followed by engineering at 8%. According to Web of Sciences, an
                online database of publications, “Clinical Neurology” was the
                field
                with the highest number of publications from University
                researchers

                At Brown, the National Science Foundation and the NIH are two of
                the
                federal agencies where researchers most commonly submit their
                proposals, according to Hirth. The U.S. Department of Energy and

                Compared to other Ivy League schools, Brown receives
                considerably
                less funding from federal agencies, with the third-lowest R&D
                expenditures from federal institutions. In 2023, the University
                spent around $239 million in federal funding on these
                expenditures,
                while Columbia spent over $988 million.

            Brown also receives funding from other institutions, such as
            businesses and nonprofit organizations. While federal funding
            constitutes nearly 68% of R&D expenditures, over $113 million come
            from these external sources. Only $32,000 came from local and state
            governments in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            But even without the effects of federal funding cuts, researchers
            still face the possibility of funding sources rejecting their grant
            applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hirth explained that, in some cases, a submitted grant may have good
            reviews, but are ultimately rejected due to lack of a “proof of
            concept.” The funding agencies may also request pilot data during
            their review, a process that Brown’s Division of Research can help
            facilitate by providing additional funding to researchers through a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://division-research.brown.edu/research-cycle/find-funding/internal-research-funding/research-seed-awards">seed program</a>, he added.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We can provide funding for the PIs to get to the next step, and
            then they can resubmit,” Hirth said. “In some cases there’s actually
            a good chance of getting funded on the second go-around.”
        </p>
            <p>
            Hirth emphasized that the University is still receiving funding from
            grants that were previously submitted, and researchers are “still
            submitting grants at a pretty high level,” noting the University is
            currently at a similar number of submissions compared to this time
            in previous years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amid current uncertainty, Hirth advised researchers to “still submit
            your grant proposal, because your chances are zero if you don’t
            submit them.”

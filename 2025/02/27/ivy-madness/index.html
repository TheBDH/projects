                On March 15 and 16, Ivy Madness — the Ivy League’s basketball
                playoffs — is <a
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/02/brown-to-host-2025-ivy-madness-basketball-tournaments#:~:text=26%20University%20press%20release"
                    target="_blank">coming</a> to the Pizzitola Sports Center
                for the
                first time in the tournament’s history. But it remains to be
                seen whether either of Brown’s basketball teams will be playing
                on home court.
                <br><br>
                With three games to go in the regular season, the Bears are
                still trying to earn a top four position in Ivy standings. The
                men (13-11, 5-6 Ivy) sit in fifth place after breaking their
                three-game win streak this Saturday night in a <a
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/bears-ivy-madness-hopes-dwindle-following-saturday-losses"
                    target="_blank">crushing loss to
                    Cornell</a> at the Pizz. The women’s team (10-14, 4-7 Ivy)
                competed
                at home as well this weekend and suffered a similarly
                down-to-the-wire defeat against Harvard. The women now sit in
                fifth place. Only the top four teams in the regular season
                standings will advance to the postseason.
                <br><br>
                But neither team’s hopes are over. The men will travel to
                Harvard and Dartmouth this weekend. Though the match-up against
                second-ranked Dartmouth will be tough to win, Friday’s contest
                against Harvard, who have the same number of Ivy victories as
                Brown, is a must-win situation for the Bears.
                <br><br>
                The women are also on the road, facing Columbia and Cornell.
                Columbia leads the Ivy League with ten victories, but the game
                against sixth place Cornell should give the Bears an excellent
                opportunity to collect another win and make up ground in the
                standings.

            <p>
                The women’s team, who have not qualified for Ivy Madness since
                the first tournament in 2017, are looking to flip the narrative
                this year. Following Saturday’s loss, the women are on a
                five-game <a
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/womens-basketball-drops-two-games-extends-losing-streak-to-four"
                    target="_blank">losing
                    streak</a> and have only one more chance to avoid a
                winless February. Still, the team’s early season success has
                shown that they are capable of playing at a high level.
                <br><br>
                In late January, Bruno went on a three-game win streak,
                defeating Cornell, <a
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/01/womens-basketball-launches-comeback-victory-against-dartmouth"
                    target="_blank">Dartmouth</a>
                and Penn. The win against Penn was
                especially crucial, as the Quakers now hold the elusive fourth
                spot in Ivy standings. Columbia, Harvard and Princeton have
                already clinched the top three seeds in the tournament, so in
                order to make the postseason, Brown will have to surpass Penn.
                <br><br>
                Fortunately for Brown, there is still hope. Though the Bears
                face number one seeded Columbia first, their next two opponents,
                Cornell and Yale, rest near the bottom of Ivy standings. For the
                talented Brown roster, a 2-1 record is more than reasonable and
                if the team can revive their January prowess, even a 3-0 record
                is within reach.
                <br><br>
                Still, no matter how many games Brown wins, they will need help
                from Penn. Currently, Penn has one more Ivy victory than the
                Bears, and so to have a chance, Brown must win more of the
                remaining three games than the Quakers. For their part, Penn
                will face off against Dartmouth, currently a 2-win team, as well
                as Harvard and Princeton, who sit in second and third place in
                the Ivy with 9 wins each.
                <br><br>
                In a scenario in which all games are won by the team with a
                better Ivy record, Brown would go 2-1, beating Cornell and Yale,
                while Penn would go 1-2, beating only Dartmouth. That would put
                Penn ahead of Brown by the third tiebreaker using the NCAA NET
                ranking, since the teams would have an even head-to-head record
                (the first tiebreaker) and identical records against every other
                Ivy team (the second tiebreaker). However, NET rankings are
                updated by the NCAA after every game. Penn currently outranks
                Brown by just 12 places, 166 to 179, so Brown could conceivably
                gain the advantage on the NET ranking tiebreaker by season’s
                end.
                <br><br>
                Of course, all of this is moot if Brown defeats Columbia, or if
                Brown fails to do that and Penn defeats either Harvard or
                Princeton. You can explore all the other ways the standings
                might shake out with the interactive tool <a class="jump-link" onclick="scrollToBottom()">below</a>.

                The men’s team has had a similarly varied season. After a
                disappointing 2-5 start to Ivy play, Brown secured a <a
                    href="https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2025/02/the-hardest-playing-team-on-the-floor-mens-basketball-fights-for-ivy-madness-spot"
                    target="_blank">signature
                    double-digit win</a>
                over Princeton. Following the Princeton win,
                the team won two more games to bring their record to 5-5 and
                secure fourth place in the standings, winning the head-to-head
                tiebreaker over fifth place Cornell. Unfortunately for the
                Bears, their Saturday loss to Cornell not only dropped them out
                of Ivy Madness contention for the moment, but it also turned
                that critical tiebreaker into a draw.
                <br><br>
                Looking forward, the men’s team has a difficult path to the top
                four. Their next two games against Harvard and Dartmouth are
                winnable, even if Brown dropped their first game against each
                team. Brown’s final home game of the season is against a
                formidable and currently undefeated Yale team. If Brown wins
                these three games, they are effectively guaranteed to qualify
                for Ivy Madness. But given the difficulty of their schedule,
                Brown would be lucky to go 2-1 — then, they would need help.
                <br><br>
                If Brown beats Dartmouth and Harvard while facing a tie in the
                final standings, they will have an even head-to-head tiebreaker
                with every team in contention for the final three spots. That
                would trigger the second tiebreaker, which is the best record
                against the highest-ranked non-tied team. That’s one reason why
                a win over Yale would be incredibly valuable. Because there are
                many more teams in contention than on the women’s side,
                tiebreakers get more complex and many multi-team tie scenarios
                are possible — you can explore all those possibilities in the
                interactive tool <a class="jump-link" onclick="scrollToBottom()">below</a>. The
                overall
                outlook is that Brown will
                probably need one of the bottom-feeders of Ivy basketball to
                knock off one of Brown’s competitors. Penn and Columbia each
                play both Cornell and Princeton, and if even one of those games
                is an upset, Brown’s path to the playoffs becomes more
                promising.
                <br><br>
                For the Brown men’s team, the season is likely to come down to
                the final game against Yale. Win, and they’re probably in. Lose,
                and the team is more likely than not left haunted by their
                last-second January loss to Dartmouth and their Feb. 8 <a

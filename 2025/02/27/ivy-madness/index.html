                On March 15th and 16th, Ivy Madness, the Ivy League championship
                basketball tournament, will come to the Pizzitola Sports Center
                here in Providence for the first time since the tournament was
                created in 2017. However, it remains to be seen whether either
                of Brown’s basketball teams will be playing on home court.
                <br><br>
                The Ivy League basketball season is entering its final stretch,
                and as of Friday, both Brown’s men’s and women’s basketball
                teams are on the outside looking in. The men sit in 6th place
                after their 3-game win streak was broken this Saturday night in
                a crushing loss to Cornell at the Pizzitola. The women’s team
                was also at home this weekend, and endured a similarly down to
                the wire defeat to Harvard. The women now sit in 5th place.
                <br><br>
                But neither team’s hopes are over. The men travel to Harvard and
                Dartmouth this weekend, playing two teams they hope to pass in
                order to qualify for Ivy Madness. The women are away at Columbia
                and Cornell. Although neither opponent is especially relevant to
                Brown’s position, those are also must-win games due to the
                dwindling opportunities to make up ground in the standings.
                <br><br>

                The women’s team is looking to end an up-down season on an up
                and take that momentum into the tournament. Following Saturday’s
                loss, the women are on a 5-game losing streak and have only one
                more chance to avoid a winless month of February. Still, the
                women’s team showed early in the season that they are capable of
                playing at a high level. They went on a 3-game win streak in
                late January, defeating Cornell, Dartmouth, and Penn. The win
                against Penn was especially crucial, as Penn now holds the
                elusive 4th spot in Ivy Madness. Since Columbia, Harvard, and
                Princeton have already clinched the top 3 seeds in the
                tournament, Brown will have to pass Penn to get in.
                <br><br>
                Fortunately for Brown, there are a few ways to do this. Brown
                faces Columbia, who sit at the top of the standings, but also
                Cornell and Yale, who rest near the bottom. A 2-1 record looks
                reasonable, and a 3-0 record is possible, although it would
                require Brown to take down a 1-loss Columbia team.
                <br><br>
                Still, no matter how many games Brown wins, they will need help
                from Penn. The Penn women face Dartmouth, currently a 2-win
                team, but also Harvard and Princeton, who currently sit in
                second and third place in the Ivy with 9 wins.
                <br><br>
                If all games are won by the team with more wins, Brown will go
                2-1, beating Cornell and Yale, while Penn will go 1-2, beating
                just Dartmouth. This would put Penn ahead of Brown by third
                tiebreaker, NCAA NET ranking, since the team’s would have an
                even head-to-head record and identical records against every
                other Ivy team (the second tiebreaker). However, NET rankings
                are updated by the NCAA after every game. Penn currently
                outranks Brown by just 13 places, 166 to 179, so Brown could
                conceivably gain the advantage on the NET ranking tiebreaker by
                season’s end.
                <br><br>
                Of course, all of this is moot if Brown defeats Columbia, or if
                Brown fails to do that and Penn defeats either Harvard or
                Princeton. You can explore all the other ways the standings
                might shake out with the interactive tool below!

                Brown’s men’s team has had a similarly varied season. After a
                disappointing 2-5 start to Ivy play, Brown secured a signature
                double-digit win over Xaivian Lee and Princeton. Following the
                Princeton win, the team won 2 more games to bring their record
                to 5-5 and secure 4th place in the standings, owning the
                head-to-head tiebreaker over 5th place Cornell. Unfortunately
                for the Bears, their Saturday loss to Cornell not only dropped
                them out of Ivy Madness for the moment, but turned that critical
                tiebreaker into a draw.
                <br><br>
                Looking forward, the men’s team has a difficult but feasible
                path to the top four. Their next two games against Harvard and
                Dartmouth should be winnable, although Brown dropped their first
                game against each team, including a heartbreaking last-second
                loss to Dartmouth at home. Brown’s final home game of the season
                is against a formidable and currently undefeated Yale team. If
                Brown wins out, they will be in an excellent position to qualify
                for Ivy Madness. But given the difficulty of their schedule,
                Brown would be happy to go 2-1—then, they would need help.
                <br><br>
                If Brown beats Dartmouth and Harvard, they will have an even
                head-to-head tiebreaker with every team in contention for the
                final three spots in Ivy Madness. That will trigger the second
                tiebreaker, which is the best record against the highest ranked
                non-tied team. That would make a win over Yale incredibly
                valuable. Because there are many more teams in the race than on
                the women’s side, tiebreakers get more complex and many
                multi-team tie scenarios are possible—you can explore all those
                scenarios in the interactive tool below. The overall outlook is
                that Brown will probably need one of the bottom-feeders of Ivy
                basketball to knock off one of their competitors—Penn and
                Columbia each play both Cornell and Princeton, and if even one
                of those games is an upset Brown’s path to the playoffs becomes
                more promising.
                <br><br>
                For the Brown men’s team, the season is likely to come down to
                the final game against Yale. Win, and they're probably in. Lose,
                and the team is more likely than not left haunted by the
                Dartmouth loss and their collapse in the final minutes against
                Columbia. Will the team be left asking “what if?” or will they
                have a chance to redeem their painful loss to Yale in last
                year’s Ivy Madness? We can only wait and see.
